We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including  standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications.  This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a  fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122.  Students seeking a more  gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course."	Anil Ada	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	900	1020	DH A302
15121	Introduction to Data Structures	10	Computer Science	"A continuation of the process of program design and analysis for  students with some prior programming experience (functions, loops, and  arrays, not necessarily in Java). The course reinforces object-oriented  programming techniques in Java and covers data aggregates, data  structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs), and  an introduction to the analysis of algorithms that operate on those data  structures.

15150	Principles of Functional Programming	10	Computer Science	"An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course."	Brandon Bohrer	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	900	1020	NA

You can sign up for 15-513 for either 6 or 12 credits.  The reason there are two options is that you might be taking 15-513 in order to review the material and qualify to take other courses in your program. If this is the case, we expect that the work load for 15-513 will be more like a 6 unit class.  If, on the other hand, you are seeing the material for the first time, then it will be like a 12-unit course for you.  So, you need to decide, possibly in conjunction with your advisor which situation you are in and then sign up for the proper number of units."	Brian Railing	NA	NA	NA	NA

17648	Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems	12	Software Engineering	"Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance.  These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited."

17651	Models of Software Systems	12	Software Engineering	"Scientific foundations for software engineering depend on the use of precise, abstract models for describing and reasoning about properties of software systems. This course considers a variety of standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines, algebras, and traces. It shows how different logics can be used to specify properties of systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such as compositionality, abstraction, invariants, non-determinism, and inductive definitions are recurrent themes throughout the course. After completing this course, students will:  1. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of certain models and logics including state machines, algebraic and process models, and temporal logic;  2. Be able to select and describe appropriate abstract formal models for certain classes of systems, describe abstraction relations between different levels of description, and reason about the correctness of refinements;  3. Be able to prove elementary properties about systems described by the models introduced in the course; and  4. Understand some of the strengths and weakness of formal automated reasoning tools.    Prerequisites: Undergraduate discrete math including first-order logic, sets, functions, relations, and simple proof techniques such as induction.   Sections D, PP and G are NOT available for on-campus students.   Admission to the class is by approval from the instructor: If you are not MSE/MSIT-SE/MITS, send email to garlan@cs.cmu.edu for permission to enroll.

The examination comprises written and/or oral parts. The student will be considered to have passed the qualifying examination when he or she has successfully completed all of the required parts. A candidate must take the qualifying examination at the time specified by the department, generally within the first three semesters of study. Upon satisfactorily passing the examination, the student will be accepted as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. If the student has not already received a Masters Degree, upon application and provided that all other requirements have been met, he or she may be granted the degree of Master of Science at the next commencement.    Passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination admits a student to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree for a period of no longer than six calendar years. If, at the end of this six-year period, the Ph.D. has not been awarded, the student must reapply for admission to the graduate program and will be judged competitively with other students applying at the same time. If the student is re-admitted, he or she may, at the discretion of the department, be requested to pass the qualifying examination again before the Ph.D. is awarded. A student may petition for extension of the six-year limit under extenuating circumstances such as a forced change of advisor, military service, or prolonged illness.

We will investigate how these emerging areas contribute opportunities and strategies beyond current practice.  We will also explore the potential the web has to offer as a platform not just to gather data but to engage. We will consider its potential to involve and collaborate with residents through urban data. These investigations are organized as a series of 5 modules. Each explores contemporary methods and workflows to leverage online data in the urban design process. The modules will introduce the means to collect and access data; tools, techniques, and context required for analysis and processing; and strategies and visualization techniques for data aggregation and synthesis.

He investigated how the manner in we think affects how we speak, move and perform activities in our lives. He looked for ways to apply the principles of the Alexander Technique to develop more ease in daily activities and more freedom of expression in artistic activities. He termed this approach psycho-physical re-education. The Alexander Technique provides individuals with tools, including gentle hands on guidance by the teacher, to address specific habits of tension that may be impeding effectiveness. The technique is particularly valuable for performers such as actors, singers and musicians as well as visual artists. The course is also useful for those in business, medicine, law or any field where she  or he has to present ideas to groups. This course will introduce basic principles of the Alexander Technique and guide students in approaches to apply these principles to fine arts such as acting, playing a musical instrument, drawing, dancing as well as day to day activities such as working at a desk with a computer, public speaking, working out, etc. Participants should wear loose fitting clothing for each movement such as sweat pants and tee shirts, no jeans, ties or belts please.

76101	Interpretation and Argument	9	English	"76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

76234	"Media: Past, Present and Future"	9	English	"In the late 1700s moral crusaders were worried about the latest media scandal: the surge in women reading novels. As one observer complained, Women, of every age, of every condition...retain a taste for novels. I find [novels]....in the work-bag of the seamstress, in the hands of the lady who lounges on the sofa, the mistresses of nobles, the mistresses of snuff-shops, the belles who read them in town, and the chits who spell them in the country. While today we might be genuinely concerned about texting while driving, or the depression associated with high levels of facebook use, in this class we wont judge so much as we will analyze. We will look at what historical media trends have in common with, and how they are different from, the media trends of today. We will read about the print revolution, the electronic media revolution, the current digital revolution, and we will also try to peer into the future. Importantly, we will take a literary and cultural studies approach to this material. We will ask, specifically, what can the Humanities teach us about media revolutions over time? How is narrative, or story telling, central to each media revolution? We will watch movies based on some of the best Digital Dystopias, including War Games, Strange Days, The Hunger Games, and the HBO show Silicon Valley. Texts for the class will also include: Tai Pei, Digital Dead End, Orality and Literacy, and How Music Got Free."	Kathleen Newman	1<>3	1830	2120	BH 255B
76267	The Short Story	9	English	"Poe defined the short story as something that could be read at one sitting. While simple enough, the definition in fact suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. In a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century, and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to, it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So, with the short story, we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling, or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention--and feeling--in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We?ll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway and Borges) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.  Students can expect to develop their historical understanding of current experience and to gain an understanding of how to interpret and comment on significant pieces of fiction. They will become familiar with some key ideas about the nature of short stories in general and the interpretation of texts., and will engage in an attempt to develop a theory of the aesthetic nature of short fiction."

The course is appropriate for upper-level students in all CMU colleges, has no writing prerequisites, and assumes that you may not have had much college-level writing instruction past your freshman year. The basic idea of the course is to give you experience in developing the writing skills you will be expected to have as you make the transition from student to professional. The course will cover resume writing, proposal writing, writing instructions, the difference between writing for general and specific audiences, and analysis of visual aids in various texts. The course requires that students work both independently and in groups."	Kristin Shimmin	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	1330	1450	WEH 5328

Likely films would include Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927), Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936), La Bte Humaine (Jean Renoir, 1938), The Day the Earth Stood Still (Robert Wise, 1938), Dr. Strangelove (Stanley Kubrick, 1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968), Koyaanisqatsi (Godfrey Reggio, 1982), The Matrix (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999), Her (Spike Jones, 2013)."

76390	Style	9	English	"In classical rhetoric, style is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?"	Carolyn Commer	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	1200	120	PH A18A

79104	Cultures in Contact	9	History	"Human activity transcends political, geographical, and cultural boundaries. From wars to social movements, technological innovations to environmental changes, our world has long been an interconnected one. Acquiring the ability to understand such transnational and even worldwide processes is an indispensable part of any college education. This course provides students with an opportunity to develop the skills and perspectives needed to understand the contemporary world through investigating its global history. A variety of sections are offered in order to give students the opportunity to choose between different themes and approaches. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

Important foreign policy strategies which will be discussed include the strategy of containment, NSC-68, the Eisenhower-Dulles New Look, the Kennedy-Johnson flexible response, dtente, the democratic peace, and contemporary approaches to combating global terror.

79292	United States Immigration History	9	History	"The United States is often described as a nation of immigrants, a notion that Americans have celebrated and opposed at different points in their history.  This course will provide an overview of the changes that have taken place in the American immigrant experience over the past five centuries.  The first immigrants to the United States were primarily slaves and indentured servants.  Additional waves of immigration often included those seeking refuge from conditions in their homeland and economic opportunity as the country expanded.  Each successive wave of immigration to the United States often met varying degrees of resistance from those already living there, fueling debates over what constitutes citizenship in a constantly evolving nation.  Hopefully, this course will introduce you to a number of ideas you are unfamiliar with, some you may even disagree with, but all of which should cause you to think critically about the past and present."

Defining the meaning of Europe or European is complicated, since it refers to both a geographical location and a shared history and cultural identity. This course will focus on the most important cultural developments and achievements of Europe in the 20th and 21st centuries. Based on an interdisciplinary approach to the multiple regions and countries located on a single continent, the course will equip students with the skills, methods, and concepts essential for a better understanding of European culture, society and thought.  It will focus particularly on such tragic events as World War I and World War II, and the rise and fall of Nazi and Communist regimes and ideologies. Students will learn how to present material effectively, to analyze texts critically and to construct coherent arguments."	Naum Kats	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	1330	1450	SH 222
79366	The Emergence of the 'Modern' Middle East: 1750 - Present	9	History	"The current map of the Middle East acquired its nascent form in the aftermath of the First World War, as the unexpected resilience of the Ottoman Empire (ironically) induced its dismemberment at the hands of victors Britain and France.  However, these abrupt alterations of the political landscape belie the more deliberative changes that took place under Ottoman auspices in the century prior to the Great War.  Hence this course will begin with an examination of late Ottoman institutional reforms as well as broader ideological movements -- namely the rise of Arab and Islamic nationalisms.  Major topics along the path to the present-day include: Ottoman attempts to confront an increasingly interventionist Christian Europe; Qajar Iran and the Great Game; post-Ottoman state formation; Zionism and the roots of the Israel/Palestine conflict; the Second World War and decolonization; the Cold War in the Middle East; the meanings of modernity and nationalism in a post-colonial context; and contemporary debates and perspectives on the future."

This could include an organization that supports projects in other countries, works with immigrants in the Pittsburgh area, or participates in international policy making/governance. We strongly encourage students to seek out opportunities that require use of a second language. Students will be required to maintain a weekly journal; write a short critical reflection on how the internship connects to academic work; and share their experience with other Global Studies majors. Global Studies advisor and director will assist students with matching their interests to local organizations and identifying an on-site supervisor available to collaborate in the ongoing and final evaluation of the students work.

80100	Introduction to Philosophy	9	Philosophy	"In this introductory course we will explore three major areas of Philosophy: Ethics, Metaphysics, and Epistemology. Accordingly the course is divided into three sections. In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why."

We will explore the foundations of mathematics, both in terms of their historical origin and their modern purpose as a base for the study of mathematics. Then we will see how problems which seem to have no intuitive solution look simple after being put in the right mathematical form, but also consider the limitations this type of approach. We will treat such issues as they arise both in applied fields (policy decision-making, physics, computer science) and as more recreational, speculative and abstract (Conways game of life, the works of Escher, music). The course is aimed for students at the freshman and sophomore level who do not necessarily intend to pursue a mathematically intense major."	Samuel Speight	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	1500	1620	BH 150
80135	Introduction to Political Philosophy	9	Philosophy	"As an introductory course, we will seek to trace out the historical and philosophical dimensions of the polis from its origins in Ancient Greece to its current manifestation in present-day society. Special emphasis will be placed on the concept and practice of democracy.  Well begin with the history of political philosophy from Plato and Aristotle (two of the early critics of democracy) to the modern period and the arguments in support of republicanism as found in the Federalist Papers (Madison, Jay, Hamilton). These historical moments cast light on the philosophy behind the development of the US constitution. Following Ketcham, well discuss the debate between the ancients and moderns, enlightenment ideas regarding liberty and equality as well as the distinction between private rights and public goods.  After presenting some fundamental justifications for democracy and our current models of democratic governance, well study the basic political frameworks of our day through a thorough-going analytic analysis of the writings and arguments of recent and contemporary political philosophers such as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Robert Nozick, Charles Talyor, Michael Sandel, and Annette Baier. The course will end with a discussion of the theory and practice of deliberative democracy and a chance for students to engage in this model of democracy through the activities of an ersatz deliberative poll."

How are these facets of subjectivity related to the objective, physical world? In this course, we tackle these challenging questions with a philosophical approach that highlights analysis and argument, though we will also bring in relevant empirical understanding of the mind and brain to enrich our discussion (a complementary course, Philosophy and Psychology, is taught in alternate years where the empirical issues are the focus with enrichment from philosophy). A central practical aim of this course is to promote development of analytical skills through practice engaging with arguments."	Alexander Markham	1<>2<>3<>4<>5	1030	1150	BH 150
