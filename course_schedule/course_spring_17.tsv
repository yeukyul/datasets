The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.

05432	Personalized Online Learning	12	Human-Computer Interaction	"Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design."

05434	Machine Learning in Practice	12	Human-Computer Interaction	"Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

05-671	HCI Project	15.0	Human-Computer Interaction	The MHCI Project course is an 8-month long capstone project for the Masters of HCI program and integrates everything the students have learned in their coursework into one end-to-end experience. Students work in interdisciplinary teams with an industry sponsor to produce a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of a novel service or product idea. The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea.

05-795	Applications of Cognitive Science	12.0	Human-Computer Interaction	The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?  The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.

05-818	Design Educational Games	12.0	Human-Computer Interaction	The potential of digital games to improve education is enormous. However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion in which students learn a design process to create educational games, digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class.  The intended audience includes graduate and advanced undergraduate students in HCII, CS, ETC, Design, and students interested in education or psychology research.   To be eligible to enroll, students must have successfully completed one course in human-computer interaction, game design, computer science, or cognitive/educational psychology, or they must have instructor permission.  During most weeks, we will have a lecture and a course meeting devoted to student game presentations, discussion of homework assignments, and hands-on work. The lecture meetings will be devoted to discussions focused on the course readings.

05-830	Advanced User Interface Software	12.0	Human-Computer Interaction	This course will cover the research and implementation of user interface software. The students will get a comprehensive understanding of all the approaches that have been investigated by researchers and commercial systems for user interface software. After a quick overview of the design of user interfaces, students will concentrate on how to implement the chosen design. Particular emphasis will be placed on user interface software tools, such as windowing systems, toolkits, interface builders, prototypers, and advanced user interface development environments. In particular, the course will cover MS Windows, OLE, MFC, Macintosh Toolbox, MacApp, OpenDoc, X/11, Motif, Visual Basic, Director, HyperCard, Java Swing, Java Beans, and various research systems like Amulet, InterViews, and subArctic. Lectures will discuss the fundamental principles behind all of these systems, while showing the historical progression of the ideas from research prototypes to commercial systems. Todays research topics and open issues in user interface software will be emphasized throughout. Students will all use an interactive prototyping tool first, like HyperCard, Director, Visual Basic or Delphi. Then each student will implement the same interface in three other high-level tools, which will be chosen so that the full range of tools is covered by members of the class. Students will compare and evaluate the various tools for ease of learning and effectiveness.	Brad Myers	2<>4	1330	1450	GHC 4301
05-832	Personalized Online Learning	12.0	Human-Computer Interaction	Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, o"															
 experience with instructional design.	Kenneth Koedinger	2<>4	900	1020	GHC 4211											
05833	"Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition in HCI"	12	Human-Computer Interaction	"Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a users context and actions.  This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities   through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations  the skills needed to actually build devices.    About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area.  The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: HCI gadgets). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models.    The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student.    There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded). However, you should not take this course if you have no programming background. This course assumes no  background in electronics."	Scott Hudson	2<>4	1200	120	4SC 104							
05834	Applied Machine Learning	12	Human-Computer Interaction	"Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

08200	Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing	9	Institute for Software Research	"Should autonomous robots make life and death decisions on their own?  Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around?  Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go?  Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons?  Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe?  As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used.  This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us.  We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates.  Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking.  The course will enhance students ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments."

The students will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural interaction, etc. You will learn about embedded systems and understand the advantages and limitations of different platforms. You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn how to build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud.   The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations. Students will be evaluated based on 5 mini-projects/assignments, class participation, weekly reading summaries, and a final project.

08534	Usable Privacy Security	9	Institute for Software Research	"There is growing recognition that technology alone will not provide all of the solutions to security and privacy problems. Human factors play an important role in these areas, and it is important for security and privacy experts to have an understanding of how people will interact with the systems they develop. This course is designed to introduce students to a variety of usability and user interface problems related to privacy and security and to give them experience in designing studies aimed at helping to evaluate usability issues in security and privacy systems. The course is suitable both for students interested in privacy and security who would like to learn more about usability, as well as for students interested in usability who would like to learn more about security and privacy. Much of the course will be taught in a graduate seminar style in which all students will be expected to do a weekly reading assignment and each week different students will prepare a presentation for the class. Students will also work on a group project throughout the semester. The course is open to all graduate students who have technical backgrounds. The 12-unit course numbers (08-734 and 5-836) are for PhD students and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will be expected to play a leadership role in a group project that produces a paper suitable for publication.

In phase one, each student will read and present a number of papers describing state-of-the-art deep learning systems and successful applications.  In phase two, each team will implement the system described in one of the papers.  In phase three, each team will scale that implementation to one of the large benchmark datasets.  In phase four, each team will do a special research project implementing a knowledge-based deep learning system based on pending patent applications of Professor Baker. As a potential follow-on for successful projects, students may participate in a summer course on entrepreneurial applications of deep learning or work as interns in a bootstrap startup based on the knowledge-based deep learning projects.

Students will be introduced to a particular firm (through one of the program advisors) and will learn how to conduct and develop requirements analysis and convert that into feature definition. The customer requirements are often a moving target: theyre influenced by the emergence of competitive alternatives (e.g. internal consultants, off-the-shelf software) and also by the team interaction with each others. Students will learn to create a product that best captures the best balance of the customer priorities and feasibility and distinguishing it from competitive alternatives. They will then use this learning to develop their respective prototypes. At the conclusion of the term, teams will compete with each other to determine which teams product is superior. In addition to having to apply various aspects of software development and computational learning, the course will help to provide students with some key insights into how biotech/pharmaceutical businesses operate.        In addition to concepts regarding market demand, students will learn how to aggregate and synthesize information related to demand, pricing and competition. They will then apply this learning to define and prioritize market driven requirements as it relates to a product. This information will then be used to build a product development plan.

11783	Self-Paced Lab: Rich Interaction in Virtual World	6	Language Technologies Institute	"Massively Multi-player Online Role-Playing Games have evolved into Virtual Worlds (VWs), and are creating ever richer environments for experimentation on all aspects of human to human, or human to machine communication, as well as for information discovery and access. So far, interaction has been constrained by the limited capabilities of keyboards, joysticks, or computer mice. This creates an exciting opportunity for explorative research on speech input and output, speech-to-speech translation, or any aspect of language technology. Of particular interest will be a combination with other novel real world (RW) input, or output devices, such as mobile phones or portable games consoles, because they can be used to control the VW, or make it accessible everywhere in RW. Language technologies in particular profit from context awareness, because domain adaptation can be performed. For scientific experimentation in that area, Virtual Worlds offer the opportunity to concentrate on algorithms, because context sensors can be written with a few lines of code, without the need for extra hardware sensors. Algorithms can also run continuously, without the need for specific data collection times or places, because the VW is always on.    In this lab, we will enhance existing clients to virtual worlds so that they can connect to various speech and language related research systems developed at LTI and CMUs Silicon Valley campus. The lab will be held jointly at the CMUs Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley Campuses. We will eat our own dog food, so the goal will be to hold the last session entirely in a virtual class room, which will by that time include speech control of virtual equipment, speech-to-speech translation, and some devices that can be controlled using non-PC type equipment, like mobile phones.

15150	Principles of Functional Programming	10	Computer Science	"An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

15410	Operating System Design and Implementation	15	Computer Science	"Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and team programming skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2s-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power."

15513	Introduction to Computer Systems	12	Computer Science	"This course provides a programmers view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.  You can sign up for 15-513 for either 6 or 12 credits.  The reason there are two options is that you might be taking 15-513 in order to review the material and qualify to take other courses in your program. If this is the case, we expect that the work load for 15-513 will be more like a 6 unit class.  If, on the other hand, you are seeing the material for the first time, then it will be like a 12-unit course for you.  So, you need to decide, possibly in conjunction with your advisor which situation you are in and then sign up for the proper number of units."	Franz Franchetti<>Seth Goldstein	NA	NA	NA	NA

15605	Operating System Design and Implementaion	15	Computer Science	"Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems.  The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware  simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and team programming skills (source control,  modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.    Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at  Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able  to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2s-complement  arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The  instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before  the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.    Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive  many more requests to audit than we can accept.

15750	Graduate Algorithms	12	Computer Science	"The course will cover a fairly wide range of topics in algorithm design. Some of the topics will be quite a bit older work from the 1960s to more recent work from this century. We hope to present as many different tools and algorithms as time permits. Most topics will be covered in two phases. In the first we will cover an important design technique by presenting a classic possibly simple application. In the second, an application will be presented that hopefully will be one that is new to most of the class. By the end of the class students are expected to be able to recognize which tool or method to apply to a problem and reasonably proficient at using this tool. We also feel that the student should be able to explain their algorithmic design idea to their peers and supervisors both in writing and orally.

15811	Verifying Complex Systems	12	Computer Science	"As the world increasingly depends on software to control our finances, drive our cars, and manage our medical devices, how can we tell whether that software will be correct, secure, or reliable?  Recent research suggests formal software verification is an increasingly plausible tool for definitively proving properties of real, complex systems code.  In this course, students will learn how to use a variety of tools to verify the correctness, security, and reliability of systems software, how to assess the tradeoffs between such tools, and how to reason about the algorithms underlying them. Students will present, critique, and actively discuss state-of-the-art research papers, complete a small set of assignments, and develop a research project that innovates in the area of systems verification.   This course is open to enterprising Masters and undergraduate students.    Please refer to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/csd-grad/courseschedules17.html for the most recent schedule updates."

15824	Foundations of Cyber Physical Systems	12	Computer Science	"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber capabilities (computation and/or communication) with physical capabilities (motion or other physical processes). Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding. In this course we will strive to answer the fundamental question posed by Jeannette Wing:      How can we provide people with cyber-physical systems they can bet their lives on?

17604	Agile Software Development Frameworks: Theory	6	Software Engineering	"Practitioners adopting agile development frameworks more often than not dont follow all of the practices prescribed by their proposers in their books. Instead they pick and choose those practices that best fit the culture and business models of their organizations or simply do what they like to do.  The danger with this is that methods are comprised of practices work together to supplement, counterbalance and reinforce each other.  Eliminating or replacing one or more of these practices without a deep understanding of the role that they play can result in failure.      This mini-course is the first in a two-part series. The first, Agile Software Development Frameworks:  Theory, introduces the student to three agile development frameworks: SCRUM, Kanban and Disciplined Agile Delivery.  The course will connect the frameworks specific practices to established group dynamics and knowledge-management theories to explain why they work and the circumstances under which they do.  In the follow on course: Agile Software Development Frameworks: Practice, students taking it put into practice one of the three frameworks."	Eduardo Miranda	1<>3	1330	1450	3SC 265

17610	Risk Management for Software Intensive Projects	6	Software Engineering	"It is estimated that half of all software projects fail to meet initial requirements, cost, schedule and/or customer expectations due to problems that occur during the development life cycle.  Some of these problems began as risks that, if properly identified, analyzed and mitigated, should not have escalated to the problem state. Despite its benefits, the practice of risk management in industry is ad-hoc, inconsistent, and often ineffective, leading decision makers to make poor choices based upon lack of, or mis-communicated, information.  The goal of this course is to develop risk managers; individuals who are capable of identifying both the risks and the underlying factors influencing them in order make better project decisions. Students will become familiar with existing tools, techniques and strategies that serve to identify, analyze and assist in mitigating or avoiding risks.  At the end of the course, students will have gained confidence in their ability to apply a range of risk management techniques to a software intensive project.

17791	Software Engineering Seminar	3	Software Engineering	"The Software Research Seminar (SSSG) at CMU relies on active participation and a supportive community to help students broaden their understanding of software research and hone their presentation skills. This document briefly outlines our expectations for Software Engineering Ph.D. students with respect to SSSG.  General Expectations: A.  Attend both SSSG presentations each week.  B.  Participate by asking questions, contributing to the discussion, and giving constructive verbal and written feedback to presenters. Using an electronic device for purposes other than note-taking or feedback on the presentation is considered to be non-participation.  C.  Give 3 well-prepared SSSG talks per year (2 if giving an approved talk in an outside venue) The faculty recognizes that students may occasionally have conflicts with particular SSSG dates; in these cases the Reasonable Person Principle applies. There may occasionally be a systematic conflict, such as an overlapping course, in which case advance approval should be arranged with advisor and PhD Program Director (but not more than once for any student). In the rare case when a students participation or presentations falls significantly below expectations, the faculty will require remedial action appropriate to the student.  The Seminar is offered for graduate credit, is repeatable, and is intended to be an ongoing activity.

18742	Computer Architecture and Systems	12	Electrical & Computer Engineering	"Historically, the performance and efficiency of computers has scaled favorably (according to Moores Law) with improvements at the transistor level that followed a steady trend (so-called Dennard scaling). Unfortunately, device scaling has hit a limit   on performance and power improvements dictated by physical device properties. To continue to make systems capable, fast, energy efficient, programmable, and reliable in this post-Dennard era, computer architects must be creative and innovate across the layers of the system stack.  This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts.  We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moores Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated.  The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance.  The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures.  Topics will include reconfigurable architectures, FPGAs in the datacenter, ASIC accelerators, GPGPU architectures, and the changes to the system stack that these components demand. The third trend is the emergence of newly capable hardware and software systems and new models of computation.  Topics will include approximate and neuromorphic computing, intermittent computing, emerging non-volatile memory and logic technologies, and analog and asynchronous architectures, and may include future emerging topics."

The class, in conjunction with the instructors, will develop specifications for a mobile computer to assist in inspection and maintenance. The application will be partitioned between human computer interaction, electronics, industrial design, mechanical, and software components. The class will be divided into groups to specify, design, and implement the various subsystems. The goal is to produce a working hardware/software prototype of the system and to evaluate the user acceptability of the system. We will also monitor our progress in the design process by capturing our design escapes (errors) with the Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). Upon completion of this course the student will be able to: generate systems specifications from a perceived need; partition functionality between hardware and software; produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems; use computer-aided design tools; fabricate, integrate, and debug a hardware/software system; and evaluate the system in the context of an end user application.

This course is targeted at understanding and obtaining hands-on experience with the state of the art in such wireless sensor networks which are often composed using relatively inexpensive sensor nodes that have low power consumption, low processing power and bandwidth.  The course will span a variety of topics ranging from radio communications, network stack, systems infrastructure including QoS support and energy management, programming paradigms, distributed algorithms and example applications.  Some guest lectures may be given.        Each discussion-oriented lecture will be preceded by the reading of 1-2 papers, resulting in a rich collection of papers by the end of the semester.  Early in the semester, hands-on exercises will be used to teach the programming of FireFly sensor nodes by using the nano-RK power-aware sensor real-time operating system (RTOS) and using 802.15.4 radio communications.  Then, project groups of no more than 3 students will define, design, implement and test a sensor network project.  Final in-class project presentations will be supplemented by a written report.  A final exam may be conducted to evaluate the students understanding of the materials covered.  Grading criteria will include classroom participation, course project content and report, and a final exam.     Class size will be limited to 20 students or less.

19101	Introduction to Engineering and Public Policy	12	Engineering & Public Policy	"This course examines the processes of public and private decision making and of policy formation, which shape the evolution of a technology and its impact on our society. Technology plays an important role in shaping our worlds. At the same time, social forces often play a central role in the evolution of a technology. A particular technology such as an automobile or computer is chosen to study technology and policy in context. Specific topics covered in the case of the automobile includes automotive design and manufacture, safety, pollution, fuel economy and their interactions. In each area, we discuss the technological and institutional issues, their interaction, the possible need for public policy and the factors that govern the policy. The course will involve several group problem-solving sessions."	Deanna Matthews	2<>4	1200	120	BH A51							
19211	Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing	9	Engineering & Public Policy	"Should autonomous robots make life and death decisions on their own? Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking.

19686	Special Topics: New Technology Commercialization: Public Policy Strategies	12	Engineering & Public Policy	"During this project-based class, students will develop non-market strategies for real-world clients. As defined, by David Baron, The nonmarket environment consists of the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions among companies and their public. This class will focus on non-market strategies at the intersection of new technologies, public policies, and business. Entrepreneurs and innovators interested in commercializing technology in the biomedical, energy, transportation, information technology, robotics, aerospace, food, healthcare, and other industries require more than knowing whether a technology works and the potential market. Non-market factors such as regulations, standards, and grants influence product, price, location, research, development, and testing, and other decisions. As a result, public policies provide both opportunities and challenges for the commercialization of an invention. Only by recognizing these opportunities or overcoming these challenges can an invention become a commercialized innovation."	Deborah Stine	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A22

For example, how does the demand for a product, service or technology change when the price does or the ratings do? How can large datasets help answer this type of question? This type of question aims at learning what changes when some intervention takes place. Facebook, Twitter, Google and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. We introduce fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study several tools aimed at measuring causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool will be discussed in the context of a specific example that students can work on using real world datasets. Each class starts with introduction to concepts and ideas and ends with in-class hands-on exercises using these datasets. Significant effort will be placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments to measure causal effects. We will also discuss challenges faced when trying to design such experiments in network settings. The course ends by looking at tools available to design these experiments in the wild. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and thus can be used in settings other than online platforms such as energy policy and education policy.

36702	Statistical Machine Learning	12	Statistics	"Statistical Machine Learning is a second graduate level course in advanced machine learning, assuming that students have taken Machine Learning (10-701) or Advanced Machine Learning (10-715), and Intermediate Statistics (36-705). The term ?statistical? in the title reflects the emphasis on statistical theory and methodology. This course is mostly focused on methodology and theoretical foundations. It treats both the ?art? of designing good learning algorithms and the ?science? of analyzing an algorithm?s statistical properties and performance guarantees. Theorems are presented together with practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own research.  Though computation is certainly a critical component of what makes a method successful, it will not receive the same central focus as methodology and theory. We will cover topics in statistical theory that are important for researchers in machine learning, including consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure. We will also cover statistical topics that may not be covered in as much depth in other machine learning courses, such as nonparametric density estimation, nonparametric regression, and Bayesian estimation."

38230	ENGAGE in Wellness: Looking Inward	1	MCS Interdisciplinary	"ENGAGE in Wellness: Looking Inward is a 1-unit mini-course that MCS students will enroll in the fall of the sophomore year, designed to give students a holistic understanding of their own personal wellness. The course is structured around the concept of a Wellness Wheel, a model for personal wellness that is used to describe the various areas that students should reflect upon when describing, and ultimately improving, their overall wellness. The MCS Wellness Wheel has nine components: intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, environmental, institutional or community, financial, social, and occupational health. During this first course, taken in the first mini of the sophomore year, students will select one of three areas on which to focus: intellectual, emotional or physical health.   They will be asked to engage in a recursive, reflective process to assess their own level of wellness in this area, develop short-term goals for the next year and a statement of a longer-term goal in this area, identify possible resources and then choose activities that promote this aspect of wellness.  Students should expect to devote 9-14 hours to the development and articulation of their plan in order to earn a passing grade. These hours are tied to completion of the requested assessments and not to the activities students elect to pursue in fulfillment of their wellness plan."	Ken Hovis	NA	NA	NA	NA

The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates, captures, and delivers value to the market.  High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential, typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures).

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.  The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace.  It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).  The goal of the project in Mini 1 is to understand the industry dynamics and competitive set, to identify a market based on use of an agile needs-driven innovation methodology (job + job executor + context defines the market), and to segment the market based on identification of jobs to be done by the job executors. These are the drivers for identification of a successful Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a market entry point, and development of a differentiating strategy and self-sustained growth strategy."

The model is employed to show how central banking shapes equilibrium in the banking system and how banking and central banking help determine employment, output, inflation, and financial market equilibrium beyond the banking system. Bank lending, interest on bank loans, the M2 money stock, and the interbank interest rate are explored in terms of the model.  A stylized history of financial intermediation explains the coexistence of banking, bond finance, and equity finance. The fundamental fragility of money and banking is explained via its evolution and the origins of the financial crisis of 2007-09. We see why higher minimum equity capital requirements for banks are the best regulatory means of maintaining a healthy and stable financial system.  We identify the intended and unintended consequences for banking stability of central bank last resort lending. Actual Federal Reserve monetary and credit policies in the financial crisis are evaluated using the model. Finally, the model is employed to show how quantitative easing (QE) at the zero interest bound works in the banking system, and to see why the payment of interest on bank reserve balances at the central bank will play a central role in the exit from the zero interest bound."

We explore the scope for interest rate policy to stabilize domestic employment and inflation against internationally transmitted macroeconomic shocks. [The two-country model is based on the closed-economy macro-model studied extensively in Economics 45-810, Money, Banking, and Financial Markets. The closed-economy model is included in the course packet for Economics 45-811, but it is not covered in class.]  We employ the two-country model to study i) the consequences of an inflation scare in a flexible exchange rate regime, ii) the nature of the 1997-98 east Asian currency crisis, iii) the implications of Chinas fixed exchange rate regime for trade and financial relations between China and the US, and iv) international adjustment problems within the Euro area.  We learn how the world achieved a working consensus on the core principles of monetary policy in the last quarter century. And we review actual Federal Reserve decision-making in detail since 1979 covering the Volcker disinflation and the Greenspan era.       We assess current macroeconomic stabilization problems involving i) politics, banking, and exchange rate policies in China, ii) the European Central Bank, banking, and fiscal policy in the Euro area, iii) capital inflows, exchange rate and inflation stabilization in emerging market economies and, iv) safe-haven capital inflows into Switzerland.

It can be (very) risky.  But the transaction itself is fairly simple (think of e-trade, etc.) Private Equity is a financial security that is not publicly traded or listed.       Private equity transactions are typically used for venture or start-up capital, buyouts, distressed companies and real estate.  A large and important component of private equity is venture capital; hence the course title Venture Capital and Private Equity (VCPE).   VCPE transactions are usually, risky, complex, and highly customized for the particulars of the situation.  The transaction is far from simple.  The complexity of VCPE deals requires the specialized financial intermediaries of Venture Capital and Private Equity funds.   VCPE intermediaries invest in companies.  A VC funds investment in an entrepreneurial start-up is an example.  And they also have investors into their fund (typically sophisticated investors like pension funds, endowments).

Among the topics we plan to cover are the role of various types of market participants including landlords, tenants, institutional investors and brokers (search). Many of the incentive (agency) conflicts that arise in these relationships will be considered.    From a valuation perspective we will highlight the role of market efficiency compared to financial markets, basic valuation methods, the role of appraisals, eminent domain, synergies between property types (parking, anchor stores, etc.) and the irreversible nature of decisions and real options.  The role of taxes, such as Section 1031 tax-free exchanges and depreciation, in generating transactions will be considered.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.  This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics.

45871	Trade & Investment Strategy	6	Tepper School of Business	"Trade and Investment Strategy is a strategy elective on the microstructure of trade and growth in private enterprise. It combines analytic with experimental methods to investigate strategic interactions in bidding, buying, selling, designing trading mechanisms, consumption based portfolio analysis, investment dynamics, and governance. We begin with an explanation of trading in electronic limit order markets, an exchange mechanism that has been widely adopted in the financial sector, is paradigmatic of most markets, and holds great promise for efficiently regulating procurement practices and inventory control in micromarkets. To analyze optimal trading rules, we investigate the role of arbitrage in limit order markets, and then probe more deeply into auctions, which are essentially one sided limit order markets. We describe the main kinds of auctions, investigate optimal bidding behavior, and compare revenue outcomes from different auction formats. Individual valuations form the basis for bidding and trading, and in the third section of the course we investigate how those valuations are determined. We analyze how investment profiles are valued from their underlying dynamic choice profiles, we characterize attitudes towards risk, and we explain preferences for consumption at different points in time. Armed with estimates of risk tolerance and timing preferences for consumption over the life cycle, we derive optimal consumption smoothing, which determines investment and portfolio choices, and motivates the demand for mutual and pension funds, hedging practices, and more generally a financial retail sector. This leads us to our last topic, problems peculiar to large investors, whose decisions affect the affect of the operations of the firm. We focus on the goals of the board members, their willingness to deviate from expected value maximization, and the means to implement their goals through managerial compensation po"	Robert Miller	2	1830	2200	POS 153							
45872	Technology Strategy	6	Tepper School of Business	"This course will focus on the strategies of technology-based products. We will examine how technology products differ from non-technology-based products and how the unique attributes of high-technology products influence the marketing strategies and tactics of those products. We will cover issues such as the diffusion of high technology products and crossing the chasm; pricing of technology products including versioning and bundling; compatibility; standardization within product markets; competition in technology-focused product arenas; continuous versus discontinuous product changes and the product line. Examples of technology-intensive industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. Students explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. This course is ideal for students who want to pursue a career as a product/product line manager for a technology company.     This course helps students understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. Students study, for example: Why firms in technology markets give away their best products for free. Why Apple taxes consumers for hardware but subsidizes music, movies, etc. while Amazon subsidizes their hardware but tax software (music, books, movies, etc).

45872	Technology Strategy	6	Tepper School of Business	"This course will focus on the strategies of technology-based products. We will examine how technology products differ from non-technology-based products and how the unique attributes of high-technology products influence the marketing strategies and tactics of those products. We will cover issues such as the diffusion of high technology products and crossing the chasm; pricing of technology products including versioning and bundling; compatibility; standardization within product markets; competition in technology-focused product arenas; continuous versus discontinuous product changes and the product line. Examples of technology-intensive industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. Students explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. This course is ideal for students who want to pursue a career as a product/product line manager for a technology company.     This course helps students understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. Students study, for example: Why firms in technology markets give away their best products for free. Why Apple taxes consumers for hardware but subsidizes music, movies, etc. while Amazon subsidizes their hardware but tax software (music, books, movies, etc). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies.

45873	Competitive Strategy	6	Tepper School of Business	"This course in strategy provides advanced training in strategy based some of the newer developments in the field. It is designed to provide training for those going into consulting, investment banking, entrepreneurial startups, and corporate development. Competitive strategy in todays advanced economy reflects a mix of traditional strategies, designed to sustain advantage through physical assets and economies of scale, as well as newer strategies designed to gain advantage through information assets and network effects. The approach used to account for these increasing market dynamics is sustainability analysis, a method that formulates product strategies according to their expected profit half-life. We begin by looking at the different ways a corporation can be structured to give it an advantage. These include degrees of vertical integration, ranging from fully integrated (complete ownership of all the stages of value added), to virtually integrated (where the various stages of the company are linked electronically without ownership). We also look at advantages to be had through horizontal integration (core competencies), where components of value from different products are shared to yield sideways economies of scale. We then look at traditional big business strategy, where economies of scale dominate along with continuous, controlled innovation; a process referred to as scale orchestration. These standard cycle examples include Toyota, Federal Express, McDonalds, Toyota, Starbucks, and Las Vegas Casinos. We next look at Schumpeterian markets, where rapid wealth creation is followed by the gale of creative destruction, which yields advantage that must be renewed rapidly. Here, managers must obsolete their own products at a faster rate than competitors. These fast cycle examples include Intel, the golfing industry, Samsung smart phones and Zara."

All levels of an organization need to make predictions ranging from numerical forecasts of sales and earnings to predictions in which they have very limited data available to assist them such as predicting competitive response.  Perhaps the most common mistake is overconfidence.  The goal of this course is to teach students how to overcome their biases and make predictions not only in data rich environments but also ones that are data poor.  The course is designed to teach students how to make predictions for a wide variety of events and numbers.  To help develop their prediction skills, the course will provide 1) a structure and methodologies for making predictions and 2) the psychology of forecasting, and 3) incorporate them into a probabilistic framework.  Techniques we advocate are updating frequently, using baselines, learning from your mistakes, providing probabilistic not deterministic predictions, avoiding the use of ideological beliefs as the basis for predictions, and combining multiple and potentially disparate sources of information.

45934	Interactive Marketing	6	Tepper School of Business	"Marketing strategy has at its core a customer-centered focus. Electronic media does not change this focus, but our ability to foster this interaction with technology has been dramatically increased. The Internet provides new forms of communications like web sites, e-mail, social media, and mobile communications. However, these technologies do not necessarily replace traditional marketing vehicles like mass media, direct mail, and telephone marketing, but instead augment them to improve the customer experience. The basic premise of this course is that these technologies can be used to fulfill the goal of a customer-centered marketing strategy.  This course advocates an interactive marketing strategy as a framework for how to go about marketing to consumers with electronic tools. Interactive marketing evolves this strategy further by focusing not just on the companys interaction with the customer (e.g. advertising and direct communications) but the customers interaction with the company. This interaction has been enabled by electronic technology, such as the Internet, World Wide Web, E-mail, Instant Messaging, Search, and Social Media. The basic premise of the course is that these technologies (of which the Internet is the most prevalent) are bringing about radical changes in how markets work. These changes are brought about by cheap and powerful computing available to all members of the marketplace: customers, channels and producers."	Alan Montgomery	1<>3	1330	1515	IA CP AUD

45944	Developing Star Performers	6	Tepper School of Business	"This seminar will explore two topics: 1) Understanding the role of star performance and high productivity in both career development and organizational success. 2) Learning how to develop star performance and high productivity. A major premise of the course is that star performers are made, not born. The difficulty is that workers often do not know how to achieve star performance. Many believe that it results primarily from innate talents or political game playing. Or, they engage in a trial-and-error approach that frequently leads to disappointing productivity results and undermines their self-esteem. In contrast, this course will focus on the work strategies and behaviors that star performers use to distinguish themselves. Students will learn what they need to do for their own development and, if time permits, what they can do to help develop subordinates/co-workers. ** NOTE: This is an experimental course bringing field based research to the classroom. It is a work in progress, building upon previous versions taught at Tepper. To the instructors knowledge, no course like it exists in any MBA program.   This course will integrate research and skill development. It will take an active learning approach requiring 1) high personal introspection/reflection/learning via outside class homework activities/readings and 2) high interaction during class where students will share their knowledge/learnings/insights/experiences with each other. This means that students must attend, come prepared, and participate in each class."	Robert Kelley	1	1830	2200	POS 146							
45950	Operations Researach Implementations	6	Tepper School of Business	"The focus of this course is on such professional operations research implementations, where implementation firstly refers to implementing a mathematical model on a computer using a professional optimization system.  In addition, the course also discusses potential issues and challenges that are encountered when implementing the outcome of an operations research project in practice.  The course extends known optimization modeling concepts such as variables, objectives and constraints with more abstract modeling concepts such as index sets and parameters, which are indispensable when formulating large-scale optimization models. Furthermore, the course describes how operations research projects can benefit from multiple models that interact to solve the problem.  These (and other) topics are combined with hands-on experience with a professional modeling system.  The course will include a project to be done in small groups as well as weekly programming assignments.  At the end of this course, you will have learned how large-scale optimization problems (involving hundreds or thousands of variables and constraints) can be solved using a professional optimization system.  In particular, you will have experienced the process of operations research implementations through modeling, implementing, solving, and reporting a realistic operations research project"	Michael Trick<>Willem-Jan Van Hoeve	2<>4	1330	1515	IA CP AUD

45960	Sustainable Operations	6	Tepper School of Business	"In this course we will explore and develop definitions of sustainability in general, and sustainable operations in particular.  We will also investigate how companies can evaluate and implement sustainability measures, and different motivations for firms to engage or invest in sustainable efforts.    We will approach sustainable operations from the value chain perspective, by identifying opportunities for sustainable actions and policies at different phases in the product life cycle. These phases range from research and development to the point where products are discarded by the consumer, for potential reuse or recycling.  We will use quantitative operations models and techniques to analyze and evaluate the viability of these sustainable opportunities.    Specific course topics may include: triple Bottom Line (3BL), Life Cycle Assessment, Carbon Disclosure, Remanufacturing, Closed-Loop Supply Chains, Sustainable Product Design, LEED building, ISO 14000, and Sustainable Resource Extraction.  This course will use cases and assignments (in groups) to support the material discussed in class.  An open book, open notes, individual exam will conclude the course."

45966	Catastrophic Risk Analysis	6	Tepper School of Business	"Catastrophic risk can end corporate life. Catastrophic risks are unanticipated losses or damage that cripple an organization and often lead to a survival mode. The following questions are examples of corporate survival situations that are the results of catastrophic risks. BP systematically underestimated physical risks, costing the company 20 billion and the CEO his job. Risk management failures forced the Johns-Manville company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy for 5 years. We will answer these and other real-world questions with tools of risk assessment and management. You will learn the good and bad points of using fault and event trees, statistical problem formulation, probabilistic risk analysis, human health risk tools, and risk communication as inputs for corporate strategy and resource allocation. We will discuss how to quantify, analyze, and manage physical risks that may be essential to your business. We will learn how companies deal with (or deny) the inevitable risks that accompany any business. The course contains four modules:  1) Definition of catastrophic risk; 2) Examples of company-threatening risks; 3) Decision models for physical risk management; and 4) Case studies. You will come out of this course with the skills to understand and manage catastrophic physical risks  skills that are increasingly valuable to companies worldwide."

It builds on the lessons from 48-100 about clear architectural communication and abstract spatial-definition, but adds a greater emphasis on the material and experiential understanding of how architecture is made and used.  We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas.  We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history.   We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria.  Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design.  The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks."	Kai Gutschow	1<>3<>5	1330	1450	MM 103

Following the New Materiality evident in architecture today, and acknowledging the importance of materials and assembly techniques for sustainable design, we seek to explore the aesthetic and experiential meaning of materials (WHY?), and the technical knowledge related to the use of materials and the processes of construction (HOW?).  The creative opportunities and design implications of using varied materials, structural systems, fabrication and assembly techniques--both analogue and digital--are elaborated, especially as they determine the artistic, conceptual, poetic, creative, spatial, and experiential aspects of architecture.  The studio projects, lectures, and the required building study will focus on the application and integration of knowledge acquired in a parallel Materials  Assembly course 48-215."

As part of the technology sequence, 48-215 introduces and examines the fundamentals between design intent and construction materials, the science of materials (performance) and their assemblies. Learning how materials and techniques inform spatial and form making decisions will be a central theme to the semester. Lectures and discussions will focus on the meaning, aesthetics and techniques related to the use of materials and the process of construction. Field trips will provide further depth into these topics. A basic understanding of essential, well-known systems of building construction will be our base line. Discussions and case studies of contemporary systems that extend, experiment and question these known systems will introduce you to the great depth to which this basic knowledge can lead you. Joint assignments with the second year design studio will provide you with an opportunity for an in-depth exploration of these fundamentals of construction through a direct application and synthesis of this new knowledge to your studio project. This course will introduce a basic understanding, selection, design, preliminary sizing and methodology of construction systems organized by the 16 divisions of construction, as defined by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) as well as and introduction to the International Building Code (IBC) with special attention given to fire protection, types of construction, and means of egress."

Reflecting the inseparable relation between building and human needs, this course is not only a history of architecture, but also a history through architecture.  It examines architectural and urban design as a form of cultural expression unique to its time and place. The design, use, meaning and legacy of a building is conditioned not only by the architects will or the patrons desire, but also by a web of technological, religious, social, cultural, economic, and political factors of the time. This foundation course is the first in the architectural history sequence, and introduces students to the subject and skills of world architectural history.

The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to ones sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed. Material Selection: The degree to which the selected building materials and their implementation are appropriate to the occupancy, articulate the architectural order, and satisfy the physical design requirements. Constructability: The degree to which the proposed building is developed in response to an understanding of the processes of construction.  Presentation: The clarity, craft and completeness of the presentation."	Stephen Lee	1<>3<>5	1330	1450	CFA 214							
48327	Modeling Moderns	9	Architecture	In taking this elective you will become familiar with a full set of construction drawings by Eero Saarinen and Associates. The drawings describe two adjacent buildings completed in 1955 at the center of the MIT campus. One is an innovative thin-shell concrete vault forming the Kresge Auditorium and the other an exquisite brick drum which is the Chapel. The class will use these archive documents to make interpretive digital and physical models of the buildings.

48351	Human Factors in Architecture	9	Architecture	"Required course Human Factors is an investigation of what makes buildings tick for people: the internal spaces, transitional spaces, transactional spaces, defensible space, owned space, shared space, public space, and most importantly, occupied space. We move up in scale from the individual and group to the community to consider our designers biases in how we analyze the human needs, how we judge the quality of space and subsequently, how we apply this knowledge to our own design work. Students develop a research question and test it in field research using observation, interviews and surveys. They draw conclusions about the quality of a space and place and how to improve it. Students should leave this class with the ability to discern a problem, experience in applying their understanding of behavioral settings and the human condition to specific research foci, and the ability to use their knowledge and skills deftly in practice, where time and resources are limited. Assignments will be a mix of individual and group work, with emphasis on the latter. There will be an emphasis on reading relevant literature, field investigations and understanding research methods and collaboration for applications in practice."

48440	"American Regions & Regionalism: An Architectural History of Place, Time, and Cul"	9	Architecture	"Despite the leveling forces of mass culture and globalization, the geographic and social diversity of the U.S. has created distinctive regional mosaics of landscape and architecture. Say New England and images of English Pilgrims, town greens with white framed churches, and industrial mill villages may come to mind. The Southwest conjures different images, perhaps of adobe pueblos, Spanish friars, arid ranches, and the color turquoise. The built environment of the Midwest, the California coast, the Mississippi Delta, and many places in between reflect particular regional identities that have been both unconsciously and consciously created over time. This course examines the historical development of regional patterns in the American built environment. It investigates how and why a regions architectural identity evolved in the ways that it did. To what degree is place something to respond to, to interact with, and to what degree is place something that is created? Our focus will be primarily pre-20th century when the forces of vernacular traditions were stronger, we will also examine more recent trends of regionalism as an aesthetic choice and a theoretical stance."

48442	History of Asian Architecture	9	Architecture	"The development of Indian, Chinese, Korean and Japanese urban space and architecture was guided by both originality and assimilation. This course is intended to serve as an introduction to the evolution of urban spaces and the function of the architecture within them. It is organized chronologically and will examine the impact of indigenous philosophical principles as well as Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian concepts on the organization of villages, capital cities, and religious centers. The course will begin in the Indus Valley. We will examine Indian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. We will then move through urban organization and Buddhist temples in Korea to Japan where the Chinese model was adopted for early Japanese capitals. Chinese, Korean and Japanese religious centers will be studied as examples of both indigenous ideas and the adoption of Buddhist beliefs and temple organization. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through group projects that will examine specific structures from an Asian country of their choice. Each group will situate the modern buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation and propose ways that modern building design could be used in their own future work"	Susan Zitterbart	2<>4	900	1020	CFA 206A							
48448	History of Sustainable Architecture	9	Architecture	"The History of Sustainable Architecture investigates themes of nature, ecology, pollution and conservation in the built environment and visual arts. The term ?sustainable architecture? is a comparatively recent one, arising in reaction to the destructive and toxic nature of the industrial era and its strident ambassador, Modern architecture. Yet, an esthetic and philosophical view of harmony with nature accompanies many forms of historical human activity in the built environment. Similarly, issues of waste removal, mechanical systems and natural materials that characterize current concerns have illustrative historical roots in numerous civilizations going back centuries and even millennia in pre-Industrial or non-industrial cultures. This course will engage texts and examples relating not simply architecture, landscape and urban history, but also art, philosophy and popular culture as a means to understand the many precedents for today?s interest in sustainable architecture and planning. The course will examine texts and works by figures including Vitruvius, Pliny, Leon Battista Alberti, Thomas Cole, Frederic Law Olmsted, Buckminster Fuller, Reyner Banham, Ebenezer Howard, Hassan Fathy, Bernard Rudofsky, Norman Foster, Robert Smithson, Andy Goldsworthy and more. Students will be encouraged to apply principles from the class to understanding and execution of work in their own discipline."	Charles Rosenblum	2<>4	1200	120	CFA 102

A series of weekly workshops, readings, discussions, and guest lectures will help students move from wide-open initial ideas about issues they are curious about and seek to explore, to the development of a rigorous research process that builds on existing knowledge and attempts to develop new ideas and advances the discipline.  The class will explore the difference between design and research in architecture, how different research methods and modes of representation can be leveraged, and how concepts of disciplinarity and project can focus a topic.   Students will begin to identify precedents, key readings and a research bibliography, an overview of the general topic they will research in depth, a detailed plan for a years worth of independent thesis work, and a well-defined end-product, likely a design proposal.  An important task will be to identify advisors who can support, guide, and critique your work, who can act as intellectual collaborators as much as evaluators.

The seminar draws on the instructors research, teaching, and practice including current projects, focusing on urban design and planning current projects relevant to international, North American, and Pittsburgh perspectives.   The course is divided into three units: The Campus in Context; Waterfronts in Transition, and Districts and Design--how urban districts achieve and sustain a meaningful density of interaction and opportunity, and the role of architecture, design, and arts in that achievement. These built environments is that they test the capacity of architecture and development to propose meaningfully complex and resilient program and form, from city centers to polycentric regions.  The seminar will address how the design and planning of campuses, waterfronts, and specific districts can build up--or tear down--a robust urbanism: to better understand the decisions that can lead to an urbanism that is experientially stimulating, architecturally rich, local and global, and diverse and deep enough for the long term.

It focuses on the empirical evaluation of the built environment (building components and systems, interactions between building, occupants and environmental conditions) in view of multiple performance criteria (thermal, visual and acoustic performance). Field measurement and assessment techniques will be introduced. The empirical methods of building analysis are commonly used to: describe/specify building components; study the real-time behavior of buildings; detect the causes of building failures; and gather data for model validation. The course will address these issues, both theoretically and practically, through the application of: field measurement techniques; physical modeling methods; and computer-aided building modeling. Computer-aided data processing techniques will be applied for the analysis and interpretation of the results of model and field studies. The role of building performance simulation in the area of building diagnostics will be investigated"	Omer Karaguzel	1<>3	1030	1150	MM 415IW							
48723	Performance of Advanced Building Systems	9	Architecture	"Advanced Building Systems Integration   This is a graduate level course that focuses on commercial building   performance achieved through systems integration.  In lectures, class   discussion, and student projects, we will explore the topic of building   performance, the design and technical strategies that support sustainable   high performance; the design, construction and operation processes that   are likely to produce sustainable high(er) performance buildings; and the   current state of theory versus practice.     The course assumes a basic understanding of buildings impact on the   environment, of building design and materials performance, and the   calculation of building heating and cooling loads.  On that foundation,   we will examine the concept of systems integration and how this approach   can sustain the occupants and the environment far better than   conventional design, construction and operation.  Although US climate,   building conventions and codes will be our reference point, we will   broaden our discussion by using examples and data from many other   countries.  An essential aspect of our exploration will be identifying   successful built projects and examining the factors that may have allowed   those projects to succeed.     If this course meets its objectives, students who successfully complete   the material will understand and be able to discuss sustainable building   performance characteristics, will understand the systems integration   approach and how it differs from conventional approaches to building   design, and will know how to positively affect architectural and   engineering decisions to support the design, construction and operation   of sustainable high performance buildings."

Youll also dive into the fields of VR/AR/MR and experiment with combining these disciplines with physical computing. Through weekly exercises and a term project the class will introduce basic analog electronics, microcontroller programming, projection mapping and virtual reality; as well as exploration into using kinetics and materials to make the things you design perform. Emphasis will be on creating innovative experiences. The graduate edition of this course will require additional work including a paper that can be submitted to a peer-reviewed interaction design conference such as CHI, UIST, or TEI. Students from all disciplines are welcome: but please note that the class demands that you master technical material. Experience in at least one of: programming, electronics, or physical fabrication is strongly recommended.(Participants will provide their own supplies and materials.)"

48752	Zero Energy Housing	9	Architecture	"Net zero energy construction has gone from concept to policy in just a few years, but built examples are still rare. What does it take, technically, to achieve net zero and what else, beyond technical requirements, advances or impedes a net zero future? 48-752 is a graduate level class that explores net zero energy design and construction in the residential sector. Through case studies and applied projects, we will explore what it takes to achieve quantitative net zero in residential buildings while maintaining occupant comfort and satisfaction. In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings. Although our focus is residential, many of the concepts and strategies we cover have parallels in the commercial sector. Students who enroll in the class must know how to calculate without software heat loss and heat gain for a small building. You are also expected to have a fundamental understanding of residential design and construction, plan reading and mechanical systems; US residential materials and construction methods for net zero will be covered in class."

Designers need to be good human observers in order to design for human needs. Designers also need empathy. This course aims to deepen sensitivity to others by first better understanding ourselves.   Informed by Manfred Max-Neefs classification of fundamental needs and other relevant materials, we will create two in-depth photo-essays, the first being a study of ourselves, the second being a study of someone who is unfamiliar to us. In the first half of this course, while looking at the tradition of self-portraiture in photography and other media, we will be making in-depth photographic stories of ourselves. In addition to photographs, we may make scans of objects, include personal artifacts and anything else that may contribute to building an in-depth self-portrait. In the second part of the semester, we will apply what we learned to a person who we do not know, in hopes of bringing new insights and methods to understanding for another. In addition, we will look at the rich literature that exists in documentary photography about representing the other. By the end of the semester, each students work will be made into a hand-made Japanese stab book of two volumes: a volume on oneself, and one on another.

51385	Design for Service	9	Design	"Technology has drastically changed society, and how we design needs to respond, too. Consider the experience of buying shoes. In past decades, before the advent of technology, customers went to a shoe store, were fitted by a clerk, and purchased shoes based on the stock in the store. Fast forward to today, where hundreds of brands and thousands of styles can be browsed online, shipped in 24 hours, and returned if less than perfect for free. The shoe purchase experience relies on system of services and products to satisfy ones needs and desires for new shoes. In this course, we will collectively define and study services and product service systems, and learn the basics of designing them. We will do this through lectures, studio projects, and verbal and written exposition. Classwork will be done individually and in teams. In some instances, we work with an external client to re-envision their core service offering."	Molly Steenson	2<>4	1130	1320	MM 203							
51391	Morality Play: Laboratory for Interactive Media & Values Education	12	Design	"What do you get when you cross cutting edge interactive media technologies with inquiry into the big questions of human existence? Lets find out New technologies-including online gaming, interactive film, social media, podcasts and smartphone apps-have enormous potential to change the way people learn. Especially intriguing is their potential to promote active, exploratory learning. We have only scratched the surface of this potential. Imagine interactive technologies that impart a deep understanding of the human condition. Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity. Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion. What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education? In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue. Then, instead of producing a term paper, well collaborate with a team from CMUs Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life. The result will push the boundaries of what is possible in the way of technologically mediated learning."	Andy Norman	2<>4	1030	1150	DH 4303							
51396	Design Ethos & Action	9	Design	"Increasingly, designers have the potential to operate as agents of change in a broad range of areas including corporate, government, non-profit, social innovation start-ups, and sustainability projects. With so much choice on the horizon, some designers may wonder, What value do I bring to the world through design? Values often are implicit and may vary across contexts (e.g., profit, efficiency, effectiveness, fairness, social impact, environmental impact). This course focuses on exploring and identifying the potential for positive and negative impact that design can have in the world around us. For example, how might a designer embed values related to sustainability, gender equality, or race relations into his or her design projects and design practice?"

51426	Beginning Book Arts Lab	6	Design	"Beginning Book Arts Lab Class.  6units.  (This class is a prerequisite for the  Advanced Book Arts Workshop Lab Class).    This is a class of basic issues regarding hand bookbinding  and letterpress printing. Its purpose is to develop a basic  structural sense of book forms, of flat format work and of three  dimensional forms. Learning hand craft techniques, developing  hand skills and the sensitivity to materials are also a goal.  Binding projects assigned will target the unique nature of  papers, fabrics and archival card-boards. Structural procedures  and techniques will be identified with each assigned binding project.  The binding projects will be:  A hardcover for a paper back book,  a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine,  and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted  to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book  form, or as a set of un-bound pages.  The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique  to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast  metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press,  proofing, and production printing. Each semester a small class  edition project of text content and image, in two-color  registration, is designed, hand set and printed.  Image generation can be by hand cut block, assembled  type-high forms, or digital process to polymer plate.    This class is not to be repeated."	Joseph Dicey	NA	NA	NA	MM B4							
51427	Advanced Book Arts Workshop	9	Design	"Students will be required to plan and design projects that relate to binding, or digital printing, or letterpress printing, or hand-setting of cast metal type. Projects utilizing a combination of all processes can be planned as well. Experimental work, or Artists Books are also encouraged. In this class structure students will be able to plan and design projects that are complete books, with printed content, or with out content. Other flat structures, and three dimensional containers are examples of general forms that will be categorized as binding work. Students who wish to enroll in this course must have already taken Beginning Book Arts, and must also speak to the instructor directly about project ideas.  Emphasis for binding is working independently with a greater level of hand craft and a sensitivity to materials.  Emphasis for letterpress printing is to learn in depth, and master, the general mechanical process for doing press work.  Emphasis for hand typesetting is on gaining an understanding of the system of cast metal type, and to develop a sensitivity to typographic principles.  Instruction will be given on an individual basis through consultation at strategic times throughout the semester. Project evaluation will be based on the success of the project work compared to each students written project proposal at the start of the semester.  The Advanced Workshop in Book Arts can be repeated. For more complex project work this class can be continued for the following semester."	Joseph Dicey	NA	NA	NA	MM B4

Informed by Manfred Max-Neefs classification of fundamental needs and other relevant materials, we will create two in-depth photo-essaysthe first being a study of ourselves, the second being a study of someone who is unfamiliar to us. In the first half of this course, while looking at the tradition of self-portraiture in photography and other media, we will be making in-depth photographic stories of ourselves. In addition to photographs, we may make scans of objects, include personal artifacts and anything else that may contribute to building an in-depth self-portrait. In the second part of the semester, we will apply what we learned to a person who we do not know, in hopes of bringing new insights and methods to understanding for another. In addition, we will look at the rich literature that exists in documentary photography about representing the other. By the end of the semester, each students work will be made into a hand-made Japanese stab book of two volumesa volume on oneself, and one on another.

The frequency allowed them to learn and make mistakes as they became more experienced. With the typical video game development cycle of 9 months to 1 year minimum from start to finish, designers cannot experiment as much as they can in the tabletop space to hone their skills. This class allows designers to build and test a complete paper prototype, and in so doing acquire skills which would allow them to self-publish their title if that is their goal.

This course is focused on the rules and methods of game design, which remain fairly constant regardless of the technology used to develop a game. While technology will play a significant role in our studies, technological details will not be our focus. You will study and design games of all sorts: card games, dice games, athletic games, story games, and yes, even video games. How to design games, how to design them well, and how to see your designs to completion will be what you study here."	Jesse Schell	2<>4	1300	1520	PTC MPR

53635	Prototyping Tools for Interactive Fiction and Voice Interfaces	12	Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh	"One of the challenges of developing narrative content for interactive (nonlinear) experiences is the absence of robust tools for rapid prototyping and iterating content. In this class youll develop a skillset in Inform 7 (http://inform7.com/), one of the most powerful design systems for spatial (and, with a stretch, non-spatial) interactive fiction and text-based games. Descending from z-code creators defined by early Infocom games, Inform is traditionally used to create immersive parser fiction games, but is also a powerful rapid prototyping tool. We will explore its affordances for this purpose: rapid design and iteration, focusing on core design principles. You will create two portfolio-ready pieces: the first is a complete text adventure game focused on a novel game mechanic; the second is an Amazon Echo prototype voice command experience in story form. Throughout the class we will consider how the interface and affordances of parser fiction -- text commands provided by the player and a knowledge schema maintained by the game -- translate to modern voice-command experiences, and the final project will tackle this directly. The class will also practice visual design documentation and presentation skills."	Erin Hoffman-John	2<>4	1030	1150	OFF CAMP

The course also works as an introduction to dramatic writing for students who dont have TV writing as a career goal. This course is not a survey but rather a workshop; we dont talk about writing but rather we write. Assignments are frequent and pointed.

57109	Elective Studio (Guitar Class)	3	Music	"Using classical and jazz guitar methods, this course is designed to provide a basic set of techniques that will allow students to pursue the avenue of guitar playing that most interests them.  While emphasis will be on developing skills in playing the guitar, a basic understanding of the principles of music theory as applied to the guitar will also be acquired.    While few students will find it possible to master all of the materials presented, an exposure to the many possibilities of musical expression available on the guitar and an understanding of basic music theory will help to broaden the students perspective and make future musical experiences, such as listening and performing, more rewarding.    Each student is expected to have his/her own instrument.  A guitar in good working condition is essential.  An acoustic classical or steel string is preferred, an electric with a small battery operated amp is acceptable.    Students having no previous training on the guitar will find this class most valuable."	James Ferla	NA	NA	NA	NA

57143	Elective Studio (Alexander Technique I)	3	Music	"The Alexander Technique is a dynamic and powerful process of education that gives us a practical knowledge of simple yet profound principles which govern human co-ordination. This process teaches us to observe and experience how we approach our lives, both physically and mentally. The technique enables us to recognize and release patterns of tension by redirecting excessive effort into useful energy, resulting in improved balance, flexibility and co-ordination. We learn how to transform tension into attention, fatigue into kinesthetic lightness. Through observation, discussion, functional anatomy, and gentle hands-on guidance, we regain deep structural support and experience a sense of freedom and the sheer pleasure of movement.   This is a studio mini-course. One section meets during the first half of the semester; the other section meets during the second half of the semester. Each section can have 3-4 students. There is a 225.00 studio fee; it is non-refundable, in order for the fee to be as low as possible."	Lisa Levinson	3	1930	2120	MM 127

57171	Introduction to Music Technology (self-paced)	6	Music	"This course gives an overview of music technology through practical information and several hands-on projects. Concepts such as MIDI and digital audio are introduced and specific topics are covered in detail  including sequencing, music notation, digital recording, mixing, and production. Throughout the course, students are required to complete several projects and create musical compositions in styles of their own  choosing. The student is not graded on the musicality of these compositions, but instead on how well they meet the stated project goals by correctly using specific equipment and/or computer programs.    This is a self-paced version of 57-101. Material will be covered during weekly class sessions, though students are expected to make time in the evenings or weekends to work on their projects in either the MTC (MM119A) or some other cluster. Students with prior experience may pass out of certain classes and projects by providing teacher with equivalent work (pending teacher approval). In addition to the required projects, there is a final exam which is administered during the last class session."	Benjamin Opie	1	830	920	MM 119A

57455	Shaping Time in Performance	9	Music	"This course will look at basic questions that performers face: Which level of pulse do I want to feel as the main one? How can I shape a pulse expressively? Which measure in a phrase is felt as a main goal, especially when the phrase contains an unusual number of measures? How can multiple tempi be meaningfully related? Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important? In addition to these questions, we will also look at recent work on ways in which 18th-century musicians may have understood meter very differently from most musicians today. These alternate perspectives open new possibilities for hearing and shaping the flow of musical time in baroque and classical music. These issues will be pursued from two directions. We will develop simple theoretical tools that can make score analysis a helpful input to the decisions that performers make about such questions. We will also examine audio and video recordings by famous artists to see both how they dealt with these issues and what new questions are raised. Week-to-week work will include reading, listening, and score analysis. Students will write term papers that either use one of the main perspectives developed in class (starting from scores or starting from recordings) or else combine the two. They will also give presentations about their projects to the class."	John Ito	2<>4	900	1020	CFA 102

Every important stylistic trend and nearly every major composer in the Western tradition intersect with the history of opera, and knowledge of its vast repertoire is essential to any serious classical musician. The aim of this course is not to explore the history of opera per se, but rather to familiarize the student with much of the standard operatic repertoireprimarily through stylistic and contextual analysis. As an examination of every historical style and era of opera is impossible in this course, an emphasis will be made on those works that form the bedrock of the performance repertoire: primarily music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from Mozart to Puccini."	christopher Ruth	5	830	1020	MM 127

The course will work closely with the Exploded Ensemble to develop expansive technologies that will transform the music the group performs. These transformations may take place in many different modalities. In the realm of sound we will investigate several areas: the development of new software for sound processing and synthesis, the creation of new instruments, and experimental methods of sound amplification and distribution. In the visual realm, we will develop software for live video performance, will investigate experimental techniques for video projection including mapping and the use of depth cameras, and will develop tools for computer controlled lighting systems.

57829	Contemporary Soundscapes	9	Music	"In the late 1960s on Canadas West Coast, composer R. Murray Schafer started the World Soundscape Project (WSP). Originally conceived as an inquiry into the growing problem of noise pollution in Vancouver, the Project expanded to encompass the wider study of the relationship between sonic environments and human communities, both historical and present. From a small group of sound researchers making field recordings in natural landscapes and urban areas has grown the modern study of Acoustic Ecology on a global scale, and also the creative practice of Soundscape Composition, in which recorded elements of sound environments are expressively explored through electronic music. Beginning with a history of the WSP, this course surveys aspects of the field of Acoustic Ecology as an aesthetic, political, and ethical phenomenon, with special attention to its relationship with the creative and sound practices of Soundwalking, Deep Listening, and Soundscape Composition. This course will also contextualize the WSP within a broader history of music and sound in the background, including Saties Furniture Music, Muzak, and coffee shop music.  Throughout the course, students will participate in the activity and design of soundwalking, sonic field documentation / recording and sonic-environmental sampling, and the performance of background music. The course will culminate in a soundscape project entailing the composition of a Soundscape work, or the presentation of a creative mapping of aspects of their own sound environments; special guests will provide students with instruction in sound capture and manipulation."

57945	Debussy Analysis	6	Music	"In recent years Claude Debussy has come to be regarded as one of the most revolutionary composers of the 20th century. In this course, two orchestral works of Debussy, ?Nocturnes? (1899), and ?La Mer? (1905), will be thoroughly analyzed. All aspects of these compositions will be examined and discussed. Course requirements: This is an advanced graduate theory course. Debussy?s music is quite complex and requires a certain degree of preparation. Students will need to have: -a strong background in harmony, chord progression, and voice leading. -a firm grasp of musical forms. Course Schedule: Debussy Analysis is a ?studio? course. The class has been been divided into small groups of two or three students per group. Each group will meet with the instructor individually for one hour per week. Debussy?s ?Nocturnes? and ?La Mer? will be analyzed measure by measure. All aspects of these compositions (harmony, form, rhythm, thematic development, orchestration, phrasing, etc...) will be thoroughly discussed.  This course can count as music support for graduate students (and undergraduate students).  Undergraduate students may register with instructor permission if space is available after graduate students have registered."	Mahmood-Reza Vali	4	1230	120	CFA M160

57946	Style change Across the 18th Century	9	Music	"The eighteenth century saw radical changes in musical style that would not be matched until the early twentieth century.  Although they are often masked by overarching terms such as ?common-practice tonality,? the differences between Corelli and early Beethoven in terms of basic compositional practice ? that is, in terms of harmony, meter, and form ? represent a fundamental change in musical language.  In contrast, the differences between Mozart and Mahler simply represent different stages within a single evolutionary development.    Guided by readings from music theory and historical musicology, as well as by our own analyses of scores, this course will attempt to chart these developments across three musical styles that overlap both in time and in substance: the baroque, the galant, and the classical.  Focusing especially on composers from Bach to Mozart, the twin goals will be the ability to understand individual works in relation to their own style-historical moments, and an understanding of how musical style changed over the course of the century. This course presupposes a strong grounding in the basics of tonal harmony and form."	John Ito	2<>4	1030	1150	CFA 102							
57947	Sound Recording	6	Music	"Sound Recording (57337, 57947) centers around the Vlahakis Recording Studio in the College of Fine Arts: how the studio works, and how to record various types of music. The method of instruction is to learn by doing, and the goal is to achieve professional-sounding results.   Equipment includes a complete 24-track Pro-Tools system, professionally designed control room that can accommodate up to 24 people, outboard preamps and other gear, and an interesting array of microphones. All recording is direct to hard disc. Grading is based on recording projects, class attendance, mastering studio hardware and software, and several quizzes."	Schulz	1	1830	1950	CFA A6							
57948	Sound Editing and Mastering	6	Music	"The raw recording is just the first step in the process of creating a professional finished audio product.  Editing is the art of piecing together different takes to make one final good take.  Mastering is the art of polishing the good take to perfection--balancing all the instruments and tracks, adding special effects, setting final levels.  If recording seems like an high-energy activity--involving engineers, musicians, producers--editing and mastering are the necessary counterparts--long tedious hours of solitary confinement honing the skills of the mastering engineer.  Those taking this course are expected to have significant music skills: actively playing a musical instrument (or composition), and/or the ability to read a piano score at the least, and a full orchestra score from any recent century, including our own, at the most."

60109	Adventures in Arts Time	9	Art	"An introduction to the essential elements, structures and dynamics of Arts Histories from the earliest Prehistoric periods to the end of the Ancient World. It will take an anthropological approach, focusing on humans as extraordinary culture-makers, whose definition is inseparably tied to making Art and Symbolic-Objects. The approaches to study and research will utilize multi-media and explore the History of the Arts in multidisciplinary ways - across Time and Space.   It will start with a somewhat linear approach towards cultural artifacts and remains, surveying them from the earliest periods down towards our own Common Era. It will also take a multi-cultural perspective relating and comparing cultures across different parts of our world. The methodologies will include investigating Time-Capsules which will focus on interrelated groupings of related cultural materials organized as - People, Places, Objects, Events and Ideas. The intention is to create a meaningful matrix which brings together the most significant examples of Art, Architecture, Design, Music and Drama. The setting of the Carnegie Museums will be used as a creative-context for interacting with potent symbolic examples of Human-creativity in ways that transcend what is normally experienced in printed words and pictures.  There will also be the creation and development of an I-Story by the participants. Each students I-story will be a form of a personal journal (but including multimedia) relating their own individual historical research experiences - to the larger and more universal sequences (cycles) and archetypes of the World of Arts Histories. These creative narratives can evolve into and become important direct connections between the great cycles of Human History and the adventure of Evolution - and the individual students own narrative and story of growth and development in the present day World of education and learning."

As its name implies, Contextual Practice embraces the context or social conditions in which an artwork exists as part of the material of that work. Evolving out of the history of site-specific, conceptual, and performance art practices, Contextual Practice covers a range of exciting new methods to making art in the public including street art, interactive social media, environmental art, hacktivism, participatory art, guerilla performance, project-based community art, and urban interventions.   Students in this field-based class will create projects that work with the social dynamics of a variety of on and off-campus and online public contexts. We will research new trends in public engagement through art, architecture, and design, as well as politics, ecology, sociology, and economics.

62360	Photographers and Photography Since World War II	9	CFA Interdisciplinary	"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences."

In this seminar, we critically interrogate this idea via a theoretically informed and historically grounded examination of the relationships between urban nature and architecture focusing on South Asia from the mid-19th century onwards. Drawing on concepts from architecture history, urban studies, and the social studies of science, we will discuss how urban nature is enrolled in the production of space, reconfiguring everyday life, cultural norms and spatial politics. Challenging understandings about non-western cities as exceptions within otherwise linear narratives of progress, we will draw from postcolonial critiques to understand them as crucial sites where the project of modernity is built rather than peripheral settings where it is (imperfectly or incompletely) deployed. South Asia, the sub-continent that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, provides a rich set of historical opportunities to interrogate not just the technical but also cultural, social and political dimensions of urban nature. Through analytical reading, writing and dialogue, we will explore colonial ideologies of environmental improvement; the hygienic modernity of early 20th century planning; architectures role in agricultural and industrial development in the new nation states; tropical modernism of the post-war period; regionalist tropes of materiality and environment; and contemporary discourses around sustainability, ecological infrastructures and smart-cities."

Students will be introduced to computational design thinking, using contemporary parametric modeling as a method for incorporation of environmental data into systemic dynamic behavior and feedback loops. The objective is to speculate about performative architectural, or urban systems, the morphology of which, are informed through design protocols that incorporate environmental data and simulation. We will engage design processes in which the metrics of the systems performance underpin creative exploration of organization and form. This exploration results in the design and prototype of a specific morphological component system.

65102	Humanities Scholar II	9	General Dietrich College	"The project of European integration inspired the hope of uniting Europe not only in economic terms, but also through the erasure of borders and boundaries defined by national and ethnic identities.  While the integration of Europe in the twentieth-century has often been considered the most successful regional integration in the world, this process has gone hand in hand with the resurgence of ethnic nationalism, anti-immigrant sentiment, antisemitism and particularly suspicion of Islam, or, Islamophobia. Recently, the fragility of European integration has also manifested itself in Brexit, the United Kingdoms vote to leave the European Union.

The decision to outsource software services to providers in distant places has many risks and thus careful management of critical success factors is essential.  Likewise, products and services are being developed and delivered by teams of people in diverse locations working together. Management of these sourcing models and human capital relationships will be an increasingly important skill for students expecting to fully participate in the emerging IS marketplace of the 21st century.  This course introduces the effective fundamentals of global project management and the mechanics of sourcing arrangements including offshore outsourcing.  Students will also examine the effects of human diversity and cross-cultural considerations in the creation, use and management of information systems.  A combination of readings, participation in class discussions, and non-technical collaborative projects will be expected of class participants.  Students must have sophomore standing or higher."

67364	Practical Data Science	9	Dietrich College Information Systems	"From empirical, to theoretical, to computational science, we are at the dawn of a new revolution---a fourth paradigm of science driven by data.  Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present?  How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations.  The real excitement of data science is in the doing.  This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.  While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained.  If you have not programmed in Python before, you need to be comfortable programming in some language (e.g., Ruby, R, Java, C++) and will need to come up to speed with the Pythonic way of problem solving."

69129	Rape Agression Defense Systems (RAD)	3	Physical Education	"Self Defense for Women - is a course specifically designed to increase womens awareness of potential sexual assault and to provide physical techniques to respond to such an act.  It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto:  To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.  This course is composed of three sections:  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness  the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs  holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional  physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault."

70318	Managing Effective Work Teams	9	Business Administration	"Over the past decade, managers have greatly expanded their use of teams to accomplish a wide variety of organizational objectives.  Teams have emerged as a favorite work arrangement for such ongoing activities as developing new products, providing professional services, and starting new businesses.  Temporary groups are frequently assembled for a multitude of purposes, such as making difficult decisions, solving cross-functional problems, generating ideas, or performing unique tasks.  Indeed, groups and teams can be found at every level of the organization, from production crews on the shop floor to top management teams in the executive suite.  Moreover, advances in communication technology have created the potential for people who are dispersed across the globe to collaborate virtually, creating many new opportunities and challenges for leaders of such teams.  Teams are not a panacea, however.  Even as they become a way of life in many organizations, widespread myths and misconceptions about teams often stand in the way of effective teamwork.  At their worst, teams sometimes create more problems than they solve.  The core content of the course is a series of team and group exercises, case analyses, and readings. The exercises are framed and analyzed in terms of readings, lecture, and in-depth class discussions.  Much of the learning that occurs in the course will involve exercises, simulations, and cases that draw on students current experiences in the class as well as their previous experiences in teams and organizations outside of this class."

70385	Consumer Behavior	9	Business Administration	"Marketing, in particular, begins and ends with the consumer from determining consumer needs to ensuring customer satisfaction. In this course, we will explore the most recent scientific research in marketing, psychology, and behavioral economics on judgment and decision-making. We will develop your ability to understand and influence what people want, how people decide what and when to buy, and whether people will be satisfied or dissatisfied with their decisions. These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey.  Why people are willing to drive across town to save 5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save 5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class.  In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it."

70391	Finance	9	Business Administration	"Firms create value by making good investment decisions. Finance is the field of management science tasked with making this happen. It is a set of tools with which firms identify good investments and decide how to pay for them. Paying for them ultimately involves getting money from households. Therefore, finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economys resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision."

70427	Modern Banks: Strategy and Regulation	9	Business Administration	"This course focuses on (1) the financial statement analysis of banks and bank-like financial institutions (thrifts, mortgage banks, and commercial banks); and (2) the accounting and disclosure rules for financial instruments they hold (interest rate risk disclosures, loan loss disclosures, fair value accounting for financial instruments, securitization accounting, derivatives and hedge accounting, and market risk disclosures).  The main goal of the course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how financial reports provide unusually specific and detailed (but not perfect) information about certain risks and performance of these financial institutions. Their financial statements increasingly are based on fair value accounting and their financial reports include increasingly extensive risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures. Both fair value accounting and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures are necessary ingredients for financial reports to convey financial institutions risk and performance in todays world of complex, structured, value and risk partitioning financial instruments and transactions. While financial institutions often report imperfect (or worse) fair value measurements and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures, careful joint analysis of the information they do provide invariably yields important clues about their risks and performance.   While this course is most relevant to students interested in financial institutions, much of the accounting material also pertains to a varying extent to other types of firms. For example, many firms securitize their accounts receivable or hedge their commodity, interest rate, or foreign exchange risk using derivatives."	Jinghong Liang	2<>4	1200	120	PH 226B							
70429	Accounting for Financial Institutions	9	Business Administration	"The banking sector is important because it drives the financial growth of an economy.  This sector accepts deposits from the public and issues loans, and thus the banking sector expands in response to positive changes in retail, corporate and government business demand.  Similarly, if a slowdown occurs this results in a reduction in demand for banking sector services.  As a result, the important starting point for a financial analyst, who wants to assess current and future economic growth, are the financial statements of banks and the information they contain.  To extract this information, however, requires being able to read and interpret the financial statements of a bank.  These statements are very different from reading traditional corporate financial statements.  As a result, the first objective of this course is to learn how to read financial statements generated from the banking sector including how to interpret and evaluate these statements.  The banking sector in Qatar is unique because it has two important and separate subsectors --- Islamic and conventional banking.  Each of these subsectors have a different banking business model which in turn generate differences in their financial statements.  As a result a second important objective for this course is to learn how to read and evaluate the financial statements from each of these subsectors."	John O'Brien	1<>3	1500	1620	CMB 1064

70455	Modern Data Management	9	Business Administration	"The goal of this class is to learn organizing, analyzing, querying, interpreting and drawing conclusions from structured data, and modeling business scenarios in relational databases. Thus, the notion of Data Management here includes both data analysis and synthesizing conclusions into fact-based, data-driven recommendations.  CONTENT 1. advanced Excel functions (e.g., Pivot tables, lookup functions, connecting Excel to relational databases) 2. synthesis (i.e. the ability to create data-driven charts and top-down recommendations) 3. the use of SQL to create and query relational databases 4. data modeling and relational design, i.e. the abstraction and representation of business situations as Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams and the transformation of those into normalized database schemas.  CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS: 1) Cold-calling: I follow an active learning approach requiring high introspection/ reflection/ learning via readings/ preparations before classes, and high interaction during class where students share their insights. This flipped classroom requires that you learn the material I post before coming to class. In class, I like to focus on applying skills as much as possible. It also implies that I will cold call students as integral part of our classroom experience. 2) Final exam: This class has proctored midterm and final exams that are comprehensive and by design difficult. But class grades are soft-curved, i.e. overall class participation and class performance across years determines cut-off percentages. One of the homeworks for this class is solving the final exam from a prior year. 3) The class cannot be audited nor taken pass/fail."	Wolfgang Gatterbauer	2<>4	1330	1459	IA SIM AU							
70460	Mathematical Models for Consulting	9	Business Administration	"This course covers a wide variety of mathematical models and techniques used by consultants and which lie at the heart of much decision-support software. Building on the basic methods from the operations research courses, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of different modeling and solving techniques, e.g., linear, integer and stochastic models, to strategic, tactical and operational level decision making, and examine the most successful recent work from real life applications in detail. While doing so, we will follow primarily a practical spreadsheet-based approach to provide hands-on experience with software such as Excel Solver."	Zelealem Yilma	0<>2	1630	1750	CMB 2052							
70465	Technology Strategy	9	Business Administration	"This course is about business strategy for technology-intensive industries. Examples of such industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. We will explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition. This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies."

70471	Supply Chain Management	9	Business Administration	"During the course we will discuss the basic issues of Supply Chain Management like inventory management, risk pooling, network planning, and supply contracts as well as some of the more concurrent issues. In the face of a globalizing economy we will discuss procurement and outsourcing strategies, global logistics and risk management. As supply chains generally cross firm boundaries we will look at supply chain integration, and alliances from a supply chain perspective. Also, as more and more information can be gathered about customers you will learn how to judge the value of this information and whether or not one should adopt a customer specific pricing model. The above issues will be covered at a general strategic level but whenever possible you will also learn how to quantitatively make trade-offs between alternatives."

Lloyd Corder	2<>4	1030	1150	SH 222							
70482	Pricing Strategy	9	Business Administration	"Pricing is a critical marketing decision which enables a firm to translate customer value into profit. This course provides a first survey of pricing concepts. Instead of discussing pricing in isolation, we focus on the interplay between pricing and other aspects of marketing, such as positioning, branding and advertising. To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful."

70483	Advertising and Marketing Communications	9	Business Administration	"Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) is a strategic business process used to plan, develop, execute, and evaluate coordinated, measurable, persuasive brand communication programs over time with consumers, customers, prospects, and other targeted, relevant external and internal audiences. (source: Don Schultz).  IMC is specifically designed to ensure that all communication strategies and messages are unified and integrated across all channels and, importantly, begin with the consumer/customer.  It is critical that marketers understand the limitations of marcom tactics as well as how to best leverage and integrate marcom tactics for the strongest, most consistent and authentic brand voice in the targeted marketplace.  The entire IMC process is driven by the customer, and in the case of our discussions in this class, the consumer.   The course is designed to help students understand the integrated marketing communications model, the strategy and tools of the marketing mix and what makes an iconic brand.  The course is designed in five sections:  Part One focuses on understanding brands - iconic brands, terminology and types of branding.  Part Two focuses on the understanding of consumer behavior - one of the, if not the most critical part of understanding marketing.  Brands are built and defined in the minds of consumers.     Part Three focuses on IMC and the framework used by brand management to develop strategy, and understand audience segmentation and brand positioning to drive IMC.    Part Four focuses on understanding the IMC tactics available to marketers including advertising, social media and digital marketing, events and public relations.     Part five concludes with the deeper study of an iconic brand."	Melissa Murphy	1<>3	1030	1150	PH A20

70494	Financial Markets: Anomalies and Efficiencies	9	Business Administration	"This course is offered only at Carnegie Mellons campus in Qatar.  The purpose of this elective is to offer students the knowledge and understanding to design a portfolio. Applying core theoretical work (that originated from Carnegie Mellon) and current empirical results from academic studies, students will first formulate an investment plan for the regional markets. Working in small teams, students will investigate the applicability of the plan to their subset of stocks as well as apply standard valuation theory.  Team results will then be pooled and screened to identify the final set of stocks from which the portfolio will be constructed. This final set of stocks is then used by students to apply the underlying principles of portfolio design including the use of risk management constraints.  This part of the course will use Excel?s Solver, a flexible constrained optimization tool that students should master.   Students will also learn how common metrics (including Value-at Risk), are used to plan and evaluate portfolio performance.  The course will culminate with a formal presentation of the investment plan to an advisory board consisting of faculty members (and other relevant members)."

70496	Entrepreneurial Finance: Valuation & Deal	9	Business Administration	"This case-based course studies the financing and valuation of high-growth entrepreneurial firms in the venture capital market. We address the requirements and limitations of a wide array of valuation techniques from the perspective of both the demand and supply side of the market.  The entrepreneurs perspective (demand) concerns identifying financing needs and value. The investors perspective (supply) requires the use a set of tools to evaluate, structure and price financing deals.  The tools include discounted cash flow, the VC method, comparables analysis and real options.  Venture capitalists act as financial intermediaries and provide both capital and guidance to entrepreneurial firms.  These facts introduce unique twists on valuation and deal selection.  The course will include four cases over the mini which require group work, class participation and group presentations."	Serkan Akguc	0<>2	1500	1620	CMB 1181

73100	Principles of Economics	9	Economics	"The course is, literally, an introduction to economic principles. Its main goal is to give students an understanding of what constitutes good economic thinking. The first part of the course focuses on microeconomic analysis including, consumer and seller incentives, trade, public goods, monopoly, game theory, and theory of auctions. The second part of the course introduces a fascinating subject of macroeconomics that seeks to understand why some countries are rich and others poor, why countries experience phases of expansion and contraction, where inflation comes from, the scope for government to accelerate economic growth and restrain price inflation. Overall, the course provides the fundamental methods to reason about major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries.  (Lecture, 2 hours; Recitation, 1 hour)."

The course will address the foundations of regulation (?why regulate??) from various perspectives within the context of a market economy, highlighting the sources of ?market failure? (such as externalities, adverse selection, and natural monopoly) and potential remedies (such as taxes and fees, disclosure, price regulation, guarantees).  The conflicting goals among regulators (and why we have multiple regulators) and their impact on the meaning of regulation will be considered along with regulatory competition/arbitrage.  Portions of the course will tackle relatively broad questions such as: Why regulate? What is the law of unintended consequences? What is the objective of a policy advocate? Are regulators and regulatory policies a systemic risk? Are our markets rigged? How can regulators enhance the predictability and credibility of their policies? How costly were government guarantees during the financial crisis? Should we bar insider trading?  Should regulations be determined and motivated based upon cost-benefit analysis?  How can we evaluate the success or failure of particular regulations and whether they have achieved their objectives? How does the Dodd-Frank Act promote financial stability?

Examples of such industries are computer hardware and software, media and entertainment, telecommunications and e-commerce. We will explore the unique economic circumstances facing firms in these industries and identify strategies that enable firms to succeed given these circumstances. You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition.  This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.

76101	Interpretation and Argument	9	English	"76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.

76101	Interpretation and Argument	9	English	"76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

76185	Grand Challenge Interdisciplinary Freshman Seminar: Racism	9	English	"Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.   If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it. What are the historical origins of racism? How is racism reproduced? How does race influence identity formation? Can racism produce positive identities? Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion?  This course will examine racism in Pittsburgh, in the United States, and in several other countries and regions throughout the world. We will approach racism from multiple academic disciplines and perspectives: from discourse analysis and comparative history to literary analysis and film criticism. While we will spend time analyzing the history and ways racism and race function in our society, much of the course will focus on reflecting on what has been done and what could be done to overcome racism.   Students are encouraged to bring their own experiences, questions, and ideas into the course. Toward that end, our course will include several field trips, guest speakers and community collaborations. We will invite students to work together in small teams to design solutions to particular facets of racial inequality in Pittsburgh, from education to housing to employment to the criminal justice system. And we will provide each team with a small sum of money to put their ideas into practice."	Richard Purcell<>Nico Slate<>Mariana Achugar	2<>4	900	1020	BH 255B							
76198	Research Training: English	9	English	"Big Historical Data  The focus of this course will be a corpus of about 62 million words of authoritative historical writing, covering the Roman Empire to the present.  Its hard to overstate what a cool opportunity this is to use data-driven methods to assess what we think we know about the past.  Theres a good bit of work to be done in parsing XML and data munging, so Python programming is a must, but students will ultimately have a wide range of questions to investigate, including gender, identities, economics, historiography, networks, and empire.  Experience with, or willingness to learn, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Pandas, and GGplot Python libraries, is highly desirable.  Students will develop a Jupyter Notebook throughout the semester, with course assessments being based on its mid-term and final forms. Multiple students accepted. Those interested should contact Prof. Chris Warren at cnwarren@cmu.edu with a short note about why theyd be a good fit."	Christopher Warren	NA	NA	NA	NA							
76202	"Nerds, Experts and Geniuses: Intellectuals in Popular Culture"	9	English	"This course will begin by considering the figure of the intellectual in contemporary culture by looking to recent Hollywood films and popular television shows like The Imitation Game (2014) and The Big Bang Theory (2007-2016). Today, we commonly encounter portraits of smart people as experts, geniuses, or nerds, variously cast as techno-visionaries or hyper-specialized experts, and often struggling with social difficulties. What do these contemporary portraits tell us about the central if unusual role that intellectuals play in our culture? And how have significant transformations in key social institutions like higher education and the mass media shaped our conceptions of, and attitudes towards, intellectuals and intellectual life?  To explore these questions, well look at the history of intellectuals in literature and culture over roughly the last century, touching on a series of key moments and milieux from early portrayals of bohemia in novels like The Sun Also Rises (1926) to the autobiographical writings of controversial political figures like George Orwell and Ernesto Che Guevara, and popular genres like the campus novel and college films.  Along the way, well also read a number of critical and scholarly writings on the subject such as Edward Saids Representations of the Intellectual (1994), as well as essays from critics like Karl Mannheim, Antonio Gramsci, Simone de Beauvoir, Grant Farred and C. Wright Mills."	Steven Gotzler	2<>4	1200	120	PH A19C							
76239	Introduction to Film Studies	9	English	"This course will serve as an introduction to the history, theory, and form of film. In the first half of the semester, we will look at the early moments of cinema, tracing the historical development of film form and narrative while investigating the incipient theories that sought to define its methods and effects. Working primarily through Bordwell and Thompsons seminal text, Film Art: An Introduction, we will also learn the grammar of and various approaches to analyzing film. Additionally, we will trace the rise of the Hollywood studio system, understanding and situating its dominance during its golden age by watching movies that both represent and challenge the classical Hollywood mode. In the second half of the course, we will survey several national cinema movements, such as Italian Neorealism and French New Wave. And alongside a wide range of international films, we will consider many of the dominant strains within film theory, e.g., discussing auteur theory and watching an Ingmar Bergman film. To finish class, we will define the place of the big-budget, hybrid-form blockbuster in our increasingly global and interconnected context, interrogating the current state of the movies and moviegoing."

76241	Introduction to Gender Studies	9	English	"What is gender? What is sex? And how do we perform these identities in everyday life? Covering topics such as pornography, feminism, bros, queer theory, and transgender rights, this course will introduce you how power and inequality have historically and structurally impacted categories of gender in American society. We will read novels, scholarly texts, and even blogs in an effort to understand how gender intersects with other forms of identity (such as race, class, sexuality, ability, and nationality).   Through a combination of class discussions, written essays, and short presentations, we will ultimately understand gender as a social construct that nonetheless is meaningful, personal, and significant for all members of society."

76245	Shakespeare: Tragedies and Histories	9	English	"We will be reading eight playsthree histories from early in Shakespeares career and five tragedies from laterand some essays on tragic drama.  We will try to see these plays: 1) in relation to the culture for which they were written and which they helped shape--the newly established public theater in London, prevailing notions about social class and gender, Puritan attacks on play-going, and the like, and 2) in terms of whats in it for ushow current audiences and readers can enjoy and interpret these plays.  We will be considering what the plays have to say about the authoritative institutions and discourses of their time, and how they address us now that those institutions and discourses have been replaced by others.      Students will be required to attend and participate regularly, submit brief responses to Blackboard, write three prepared essays, and take a final exam."

Hes the cyber outlaw who we imagine can take down the powerful with the click of a finger, sometimes serving as an agent of the Russian government, at other times threatening the state itself. This course will examine the mythology and reality of the Russian hacker by tracing its prehistory, from anarchists in Imperial Russia, to Bolshevik revolutionaries, to dissident artists of the Soviet Union, and finally to contemporary heretics such as Pussy Riot and Edward Snowden. The course will culminate in a student-led symposium on the sociocultural role of the Russian hacker.   This course follows a seminar format. Students will be required to critically analyze literature, film, and historical documents. They will work on written exercises that prepare them to write a research paper to be presented at the symposium. This is a 9-unit course.

More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, well be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse.  Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kinds including politicians, journalists, and scientists strategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed.  Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends.  More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable.  Ultimately, you will conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals."	John Oddo	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A20							
76331	"The Romantics, Religion and Politics"	9	English	"We usually think of the American and French revolutions as primarily political, but they also confronted dominant religious beliefs and generated alternatives ranging from enthusiasm and pantheism to atheism. We will explore the literary and political meanings of religious belief and dissent in major writers like Samuel Coleridge, Thomas Paine, Edmund Burke, William Wordsworth, Matthew Lewis and others who grappled with Protestantism, Catholicism, Dissent, and such interesting extreme alternatives as evangelicalism, enthusiasm, pantheism, and atheism. Two interpretive papers and in-class presentations will be required."	Jon Klancher	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 154A							
76341	Gender and Sexuality in Performance	9	English	"Performance describes a wide range of practices, from the everyday to the artistic. Gender and sexuality are key elements in everyday, political, and artistic performances, from the very personalhow you order a latte at Tassa DOro, tell a lover goodbye at the airport or comfort a crying childto the very publicperforming a Bach cello suite or an iconic King Lear, staging a demonstration against police violence or marketing a new app.    How does everyday performance define gender and sexual identity? How do gender and sexuality define everyday performance?  How does aesthetic performanceart, theater, film, digital media, poetryintervene in the ways in which gender and sexuality are performed?  Readings in theory at the intersection between gender studies and performance studies will help us explore these questions.  We will read Judith Butlers work on gender as performative, Joseph Roachs work on the history of celebrity, Marvin Carlsons work on theater, and important essays in queer and transgender theory.  We will also read and view a wide variety of cultural and artistic practices, from the British 17th century up to the recent work of feminist and queer performance artists.   Your written and spoken contributions to the class will, besides regular postings on the course materials and participation in class discussions, entail the investigation of an everyday, cultural, or aesthetic performance of your choosing."	Kristina Straub	2<>4	1030	1150	SH 212							
76342	Love: A Cultural History	9	English	"This is a course about the cultural history of love.   We will focus on romantic love, with an emphasis on how ideas about love have been a dynamic part of our social, political and economic world. Some of the questions to be addressed include:  How, historically, did the idea of love become coupled with freedom?  How did romantic love come to be considered the epitome of self-fulfillment and what are the problems with that idea?  How has the idea of romantic love been mobilized on behalf of things like the state, the nation, capitalism or revolution?   How do types of love function as a measure of belonging or deviance?  How does the discourse of love enter different kinds of institutional arrangements, such as marriage or state citizenship?  As a way to explore these questions, this course looks to literature but also philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology and law.  Students will immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary range of material as they read, discuss and write about these representations.  We will roam through cultural theory of affect, psychoanalytic notions of love, historical constructions of marriage, and feminist discussions of love and sexuality.  The emphasis will be on Euro-American narrative traditions, but the final part of the course will include a contemporary global comparative context."	Marian Aguiar	1<>3	1030	1150	SH 220							
76346	Angels and Diplomats: Renaissance Poetry from Wyatt to Milton	9	English	"The starting point for this course is a question at the nexus of theology, politics, and art that no less central to the age of Shakespeare and Milton than it is today: how should power be represented? Biographically, many canonical poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms. What, then, can structures of mediation like diplomacy and angelic intervention tell us about works like Sidneys sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella, Shakespeares Hamlet, or Miltons Paradise Lost? And what can Renaissance poetry tell us about topics such as sovereignty, immunity, license, fidelity, automation, and accommodation? The course will include introductory and contextual readings from Genesis, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham.  Assignments and class discussions will be occasions to practice historically-informed criticism; to compare conceptual structures within seemingly distinct domains of history and thought; and to articulate major fissures and changes in Renaissance angelology, diplomatic practice, and literary craft."	Christopher Warren	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 255B							
76352	Listening Spaces	9	English	"The proliferation of portable as well as computerized audio technologies has radically changed the way the human beings listen, consume, and produce music and sound. With the emergence of cloud storage services like Dropbox, Amazon, and Google you can effortlessly store and share music files anonymously or with friends.  Services like Facebook, Pandora, Spotify, Last.fm, Amazon, and iTunes use finely tuned algorithms to make musical recommendations and in the process further personalize your experience as a consumer of music.  All of these services, many of which are virtual, have come to mediate our intensely personal and communal experiences with music. The Listening Spaces seminar seeks to understand the overwhelming impact these mediating technologies have had on our social, political and personal interactions with music.  Foundational readings will include Jonathan Sternes MP3: The History of a Format, Alexander Galloways Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture,  Trebor Scholzs Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory. The seminar will be focused around developing and completing critical projects that cross technological and humanistic boundaries."	Richard Purcell<>Richard Randall	2<>4	1500	1620	PH 126A							
76360	Literary Journalism Workshop	9	English	"Literary Journalism is non-fiction writing about the people and places in the world that might be overlooked by traditional journalism. Concerned more with those whose lives are outside of the traditional spot-light, literary journalism enriches our sense of who inhabits the contemporary world. Reading the stories of other lives can help us understand our own, by enlarging and deepening the context in which we understand our humanity. In this class, you will read a variety of professional literary journalism, and be asked to write your own. Youll have chances to interview people you know, and don?t know, and write their stories, along with an assignment that invites you to capture your family history. Youll write about Pittsburgh places, and youll learn how the stories of your own life can become literary journalism when you learn to contextualize them, and connect them to larger issues. The concerns and goals of Literary Journalism overlap with memoir, creative non-fiction, and magazine writing. The class is run as a seminar and demands high level of student involvement."	Jane Mccafferty	2<>4	1500	1620	PH A19C							
76361	Topics in Digital Humanities: Corpus Rhetorical Analysis	9	English	"This course investigates methods for analyzing rhetoric as it mainly exists in digital environments (e.g. blogs, newsgroups, homepages, political sites, Facebook and so on). The focus will be on verbal rhetoric, but students who wish to analyze visual rhetoric interactively with verbal rhetoric will be welcome to do so. In the first part of the course, we will review various methods for analyzing digital texts descriptively (viz., concordance, collocate and keyword analysis) and inferentially, through multivariate analysis (e.g., manova, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis). To learn these methods, in the first half of the course, we will use simple textual data sets supplied by the instructor. In the second half of the class, students will choose their own digital environments to analyze and they will be expected to write publishable-quality rhetorical analyses of these environments. To meet this expectation, students will need to do considerable background research in the digital environments they are studying."	David Kaufer	1<>3	1500	1620	SH 212							
76365	Beginning Poetry Workshop	9	English	"In this course students will read and discuss the work of contemporary poets, attend outside readings, critique classmates? poems, and write a significant number of their own poems. We will explore elements of craft through reading published work as well as completing in-class and take-home writing assignments. Though we will mostly be reading, writing, and discussing individual poems, toward the end of the semester we will move on to discussing (and writing) the poetic series."	James Daniels	1<>3	1200	120	PH A19A							
76370	Independent Study in Literary and Cultural Studies	None	English	"An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number  length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabus/schedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings."	Jeffrey Hinkelman	NA	NA	NA	NA							
76373	Argument	9	English	"This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of argument. The course begins with an overview of major theories of argument followed by consideration of a variety of topics in argument production, analysis, and evaluation, often applying the principles we study to specific cases in class. Students will each select a type or genre of argument-whether academic, practical, professional, or otherwise-upon which to focus their research throughout the course. Students will begin by developing short assessments of the value and relevance of major theories of argument to the type of argument they are researching, then develop their own approach to argument analysis and apply it to an example of that type of argument, before producing an original argument of the type they have been studying by the end of the course."

76374	Mediated Narrative	9	English	"In this project-based course students will create a computer-based interactive documentary about contemporary Cuban society, which will be filmed in Cuba during the Spring break week of 2017. The class will explore different styles and techniques of storytelling with the flexibility of form offered by the computer through the practice of digression, multiple points of view, disruptions of time and of storyline, etc. Students will work within interdisciplinary teams in the creative areas of English and creative writing, video production, interactive media, data visualization and programming. Students will be encouraged to think about digital interactive media not just in terms of technology but also considering broader issues such as verbal and visual language, design, information architecture, communication and community."

76378	Literacy: Educational Theory and Community Practice	9	English	"Literacy has been called the engine of economic development, the road to social advancement, and the prerequisite for critical abstract thought. But is it? And what should count as literacy: using the discourse of an educated elite or laying down a rap?  Competing theories of what counts as literacy - and how to teach it - shape educational policy and workplace training. However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves.  As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburgh?s inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college. We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.) As your SOS Scholar creates a personal Decision Maker?s Journey Book and learns new strategies for writing, planning and decision making, you will see literacy in action and develop your own skills in intercultural collaboration and inquiry."	Linda Flower	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 145C							
76385	Introduction to Discourse Analysis	9	English	"Discourse analysis places a primary focus on how things are said; and this close attention to the details of language in use can offer insight into a variety of questions posed by researchers across the humanities and social sciences. In this course, we will examine the way discourse is itself a form of social action that plays a fundamental role in organizing social, cultural, and political life. In addition to becoming familiar with a variety of approaches and topics in the study of discourse, a major aim of the course is for you to develop the tools and skills needed to analyze actual discourse data. This will involve learning how to read transcripts and transcribe data at different levels of detail, learning how to ask questions about the data based on different analytic interests, and developing a vocabulary of scholarly terms and concepts that will allow you to comment on discourse features as you formulate interesting and persuasive claims. The first part of the course will involve assignments with shared data to develop fundamental skills. In addition, seminar participants will be responsible for selecting pieces of discourse for mini data sessions throughout the semester. For the final assignment, you will choose and analyze a piece of spoken or written discourse of interest to you. In the end, you should come away from the course with an ability to think critically about the way discourse operates in the world."	Barbara Johnstone	1<>3	1030	1150	CFA 102							
76389	Rhetorical Grammar	9	English	"The primary objective of this course is to provide professional writers with a framework for identifying and authoritatively discussing the grammatical forms and constructions they will be using. The course also includes some linguistic analysis, a consideration of English orthography, and discussion of the notions of standards and correctness in language. The concern throughout is to develop an understanding of those elements of grammar and usage that are the foundation for good professional writing and for leadership in professional writing settings."	Mary Glavan	1<>3	900	1020	PH A19C							
76390	Style	9	English	"In classical rhetoric, style is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?"	John Oddo	2<>4	1030	1150	SH 220							
76391	Document & Information Design	12	English	"Today, many professionals are responsible for the visual design of documents. This course provides students who have already learned the foundation of written communication with an opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create visual-verbal synergy in printed documents. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary, as well as the practical issues of visual communication design through a series of hands-on projects in various rhetorical situations. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are an essential part of this course.  Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be taught in class, and used to create the assigned projects."	Susan Hagan	1<>3	1500	1620	CMB 2147							
76394	Research in English	9	English	"In this course we will explore methods of researching, writing, and presenting original work in English Studies.  The field of English Studies is profoundly interdisciplinary. We will strive to understand not just traditionally used methods (such as text analysis), but also more recent developments borrowed from other disciplines (such as history and sociology, anthropology, and visual studies). We will cover methods for developing topics, constructing research plans, finding and using scholarly sources and conducting field research, organizing, writing, revising, and presenting a research paper of 20-25 pages.  Students will also learn how to situate their work in the context of scholarly conversation, by testing their hypotheses against alternative and presenting their research to audiences in the field of English studies. Throughout the semester, students will develop and work on an original research project. At the end of the semester, students will give a public presentation of their research to other students and English faculty."	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1200	120	PH 125B							
76395	Science Writing	9	English	"This course will teach students how to write clear, well-organized, compelling articles about science, technology and health topics for a general audience. Students will learn how to conduct research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation.  For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firms marketing staff.   Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit.  Students will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles -- and rewriting them after theyve been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment."	Mark Roth	2<>4	1030	1150	WEH 4625							
76397	Instructional Text Design	9	English	"This course focuses on the planning, writing, and evaluating of instruction of various kinds, especially instructional texts. It is particularly appropriate for professional and technical writers, but also a good option for anyone interested in fields that involve substantial instruction, such as teaching or employee training. In the first part of the course, well examine the recent history of instructional design and the major current theories. Then well take a step back and study the concepts of learning upon which these theories are based, with particular attention to their implications for how instruction is structured. Youll find that different learners (e.g., children, older adults) and goals (e.g., learning concepts and principles, learning to apply principles to solve novel problems, learning a complex skill, learning to change ones behavior, etc.) require different types of instruction. In the second part of the course, well look in detail at models of how people learn from texts and what features (e.g., advanced organizers, examples, metaphors, illustrations, multimedia) enhance learning under what circumstances. We will study and analyze particular types of texts. Some possible examples include an introduction to the concept of gravity; a tutorial for computer software; a self-paced unit in French; adult educational materials in health care; a workshop on sexual harassment in the workplace; or a unit to train someone how to moderate a discussion. We will also look at various methods (concept mapping, think-aloud, comprehension tests, etc.) that are used to plan and evaluate instructional text. You will do a project, either individually or in a small group (2-3), in which you design, write and evaluate instruction."	Christine Neuwirth	1<>3	1200	120	WEH 5316							
76409	History of German Film	9	English	"This course is a chronological introduction to one of the worlds greatest cinema traditions: German cinema.  It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywoods greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitlers so-called Third Reich, when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final weeks of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.  No knowledge of the German language is required for this course; most of the films will be in German with English subtitles.  The course will be cross-listed in the departments of Modern Languages, English, and History.  Students will be required to attend class, to watch all of the required films, to actively participate in discussion, to write a 15-page term paper on a topic related to German cinema history, and to take a midterm and a final examination."	Stephen Brockmann	2<>4	1500	1620	PH A20							
76420	The Cognition of Reading and Writing: Introduction to a Social/Cognitive Process	9	English	"Understanding reading and writing as a social/cognitive (i.e., a socially situated thinking, feeling, problem-solving) process reveals some of the conscious and unconscious work behind the ways readers comprehend and interpret texts, and the ways writers construct and communicate meanings through them.  To gain insight into the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts. Turning then to writers, we will examine the key processes, from interpreting the task, to planning, revision and meta cognitive awareness on which expert and novice writers differ.  You will also learn a set of process tracing methods for tracking these problem-solving strategies as you do two case studies. One will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a set of readers actually interpret (construct the meaning of) a text you choose. The second will be an extended case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.  Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits and problems you had to solve, as well as successful strategies, which will give you new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer."	Linda Flower	2<>4	1500	1620	SH 212							
76430	Greatest Hits from the Medieval World	9	English	"Some stories never go out of style. Much of what we will read in this course was popular throughout Europe, and all of it is still widely retold and enjoyed in various media: for example, Beowulf, Decameron, and Dantes Inferno in film, Tristan in opera, Malorys Morte DArthur in lots of formats. We will consider the medieval telling of these tales and others from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries. Anglo-Saxon, French, German, Italian, and some Middle English texts will be read in translation, but Chaucer and Malory in edited versions of their writers idioms. A particular emphasis will be placed on personal subjectivities to counter the rumor that individual selfhood began with Shakespeare (the inventor of the human, according to Harold Bloom). Some of our texts are reflective, some are outrageous, some are charming, some are funny; all are populated by human beings we can recognize in spite of the unfamiliar styles in which they are presented. Learning outcomes include a sense of both the historical conditions for storytelling and the ways tales can take on new meanings over time.   Graduate students will be responsible for reading additional historical and critical materials and writing longer papers than undergrads."	Peggy Knapp	1<>3	1500	1620	BH 255B							
76438	"The Wire: Crime, Realism, and Long-Form TV"	9	English	"The HBO series The Wire (2002-2008) has been called the greatest TV show ever. Part of the first wave of quality television series by which HBO changed the way people conceived of the artistic possibilities of the medium, the Wire differed from its contemporaries like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in its realism and its smaller audience. Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling long-form TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be binge-watched. The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.    This course will consider the wire in the context of realist fiction of the 19th century, twentieth-century crime fiction, earlier TV crime series, and other long-form TV, including Mad Men. We will try to explore The Wires realism, its continuing appeal, and its impact.  We will probably watch 3 seasons of The Wire."	David Shumway	3	1830	2120	BH 255B							
76451	Language and Globalization	9	English	"It is a paradox of globalization that the same factors that cause people to become more alike also make people become aware of difference.  In this course we explore this process with respect to language.  We look at the history of language standardization and its relationship with political and economic history, exploring when and why different ways of speaking and writing become more alike, both as an automatic result of social interaction and as a planned result of policy.  We look at the language ideology that gives rise to and undergirds standardization and the rhetoric that gets used to forward it.  Then we explore reasons for and mechanisms of localization in language. What ideas about language, communication, and identity underlie attempts to push back against standardization, and what rhetorical strategies forward these ideas? We then turn to three case studies: arguments about Global English versus local Englishes and ways of using English, ongoing struggles over the standardization of the Putonghua variety of Chinese in China and the development of regional and national standards in Taiwan and elsewhere, and the history of Catalan, a regional dialect that has become a quasi-national standard in the Catalunia region of Spain.  In addition to presenting and leading discussion on two of the readings, students will be expected to complete two 500-word writing assignments and undertake a substantial original research project that expands on one or more of the themes of the course.  This project will be presented orally and in a 20-25 page paper."	Barbara Johnstone	1<>3	1500	1620	WEH 5328							
76455	Performance Theory	9	English	"Emerging from anthropology, semiotics, theater studies, and cultural studies, the interdisciplinary field of Performance Studies offers new ways for practitioners in the field of literary and cultural studies to interpret texts and visual artifacts, as well as media and theater productions. This course will introduce key theories of performance and celebrity by writers such as Richard Schechner, Diana Taylor, Joseph Roach, and Judith Butler, and give students experience in using these analytic frameworks to study a range of objects, from print texts to visual images and even ephemeral performances. While performance is key to how humans make meaning across all times and places, the uses of performance and the forms of celebrity vary historically, and we will ground our theoretical studies in case studies drawn from the early modern British and 20th century American entertainment cultures.  Celebrity is a very modern phenomenon that first became a visible part of political, religious, and artistic culture over the course of the long 18th century, between 1660 and 1800.  We will investigate the genealogies of modern celebrity, considering such questions as, what do the Kardashians have to do with dead English kings?  What can cross-dressing actresses teach us about 21st-century drag performances?"	Kristina Straub	2<>4	1330	1450	HL 106C							
76460	Beginning Fiction Workshop	9	English	"This course builds upon survey or introduction courses to exercise the writers craft in fiction. Several texts will be analyzed, in both the short story and novel forms. We will read closely with a focus on the craft of writing?the voice, point of view, character development, etc. We will develop a vocabulary for speaking about the craft of fiction and hone our skills by reading good fiction, discussing work in class and writing response papers with an eye toward the various aspects of the writing process. We will arrange a schedule in which each student?s work will be reviewed twice via peer review and in-class discussion."	Sharon Dilworth	2<>4	1200	120	DH 2122							
76462	Advanced Fiction Workshop	9	English	"In this class we will work on how narratives are told. Using masterworks to help guide our writing, we will spend the first part of the semester writing stories that imitate the style or narrative voice of several authors.   You will have a story due every week.  We will workshop several of these stories concentrating our editorial comments on story, development, character, and voice.  Your time after mid-semester will be devoted to rewriting and reworking these exercises into stories."	Kevin Gonzalez	2	1830	2120	BH 145C							
76472	Multimedia Storytelling in a Digital Age	9	English	"This course explores the craft of journalism in the context of the history, traditions and glory of journalistic nonfiction in the United States. It seeks to help you hone your writing and thinking skills as you produce pieces of substance that reflect those traditions and standards. As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalisms glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print. Students will be given assistance and encouragement as they seek outlets for their writings and connections in the media world that could lead to internships and employment."

76474	Software Documentation	9	English	"This course teaches best practices for creating software documentation (user assistance) for internal and external users. We will analyze many forms of software user assistance and discuss their roles in the progressive disclosure model: Provide the right information to the right user at the right time. The course emphasizes quality task-oriented writing and focuses on the basic skills needed to educate and guide users, while introducing important industry trends like topic-based authoring, single sourcing and reuse, and DITA. Students will complete a series of short homework assignments and several larger projects to reinforce the principles and provide experience in all phases of creating software documentation, including peer review. Readings and published documentation examples will provide a bridge between theory and practice. No textbook required, but students may be required to purchase necessary software (a DITA editor)."

76475	"Law, Performance, and Identity"	9	English	"Although rhetoric and law have long been closely associated, the modern professionalization of law has often promoted the idea that legal discourse is not rhetorical but is a rigorously defined technical discourse that can be applied free of social or political influence. This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the importance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal discourse, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. In this course we examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses constitute identities in global contexts, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War politics influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law in order to garner international support. Alongside primary sources of legal discourse, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship of rhetoric and law."	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A22							
76487	Web Design	12	English	"As the Internet has increasingly become an integral part of professional and technical communication in all organizations, writers entering the workplace are expected to have a broad range of web design skills to complement their expertise in writing and design for print. Thus, weve designed this course to help writers learn the broad range of skills needed to develop communication materials that are tailored for the web. In particular, the course focuses on the planning, design, and testing of the visual and verbal content typical of contemporary websites. As a member of the class, youll participate in a guided, semester-long web design project, which is scaffolded with a series of group and individual assignments. The project begins with an introduction to user-centered methods for understanding the audience (users), where you will learn and practice foundational user-centered design methods through readings and a series of hands on exercises, including interviews, and observation of actual users. You will also learn theories and methods for developing effective information architecture, including organizational schemes, navigational design, labeling, form design, and visual design. Working in groups with other students, you will, over the course of the semester, develop a prototype of a small website, which will be evaluated through user testing at the end of the semester. While we focus primarily on the activities described above, well also discuss sound and animation, emerging technologies such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, and social media."

76489	Advanced Document & Information Design	12	English	"This course builds on the foundational visual design skills introduced in 76391/791 Document  Information Design, and provides students with opportunities to further develop their skills through a series of larger and more complex document and information design problems. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are essential parts of this course. Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be used to complete the assignments."

76492	Rhetoric of Public Policy	9	English	"The field of public policy focuses on the study of how to avoid or resolve social problems and achieve social goals through political processes. In traditional approaches to public policy, each step of the policy process from defining a problem to making a case for its solution is assessed in reference to rational models of economic and political actors. This course takes a less conventional rhetorical approach to public policy which focuses attention on the values, beliefs, and argument structures associated with issues as a method of assessing them and as a means for moving forward with effective strategy for their resolution. Towards this end, we will be studying the theories and analytic methods of both classical and modern rhetorical scholarship as well as modern public policy theory."

76494	Healthcare Communications	9	English	"Healthcare Communications is a writing-intensive course designed for students interested in how healthcare information is developed by researchers, healthcare providers and writers and communicated to patients and their families, the general public, and other experts. Throughout the course, we will explore where people find medical information, how they use and evaluate it, and what challenges writers face in supporting informed healthcare decisions while communicating ideas that can be complex, provocative and sometimes frightening. We will read and discuss published literature dealing with issues in health literacy, clinical research, and patient care. We will also learn the basics of reading, understanding, and interpreting the research literature and communicating research findings to non-experts. Early in the semester, youll choose a medical area of interest that you will research using sources such as journals, articles, books and web sites, as well as direct contact with appropriate medical, healthcare, and/or research professionals. For your final project, you will write and design materials that will meet a specific need or gap you identify in existing information. The final project could be a magazine article, a website, patient education material such as brochures or training materials, or another vehicle that emphasizes accurate, informative and engaging writing. In addition, there will be several short writing assignments to build the research and writing skills needed to effectively communicate healthcare information. A background in health, medicine or science is not necessary for this course, but a willingness to learn about these areas is essential."	Mario Castagnaro	3	1830	2120	SH 212

76707	Independent Study in Professional Writing	None	English	"An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number  length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabus/schedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings."	Instructor TBA	NA	NA	NA	NA							
76717	Contemporary American Fiction	None	English	"No one seems to know quite how to define contemporary American fiction. Its clear that fiction has changed since the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of postmodernism, but its not clear what exactly characterizes the work that has come since. In this course, we will read a selection of American fiction from the 1980s to the present and try to get a sense of its main lines. In particular well look at the turn to genre, the expansion to multicultural authors, and the return to realism. Also, we will consider how it relates to American society. Authors might include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Junot Diaz, Jennifer Egan, Bret Easton Ellis, Jonathan Franzen, Chang-Rae Lee, Emily St. John Mandel, Gary Shteyngart, and Colson Whitehead."

76725	Intertextuality	None	English	"What do we mean when we say that someone has twisted our words, or that our words have been taken out of context?  Why is Martin Luther King Jr. best remembered for saying, ?I have a dream,? and not for saying, War is the greatest plague that can affect humanity?  What are political talking points and how are they perpetuated? How does a claim (unfounded or not) become a fact?  How does a fact become a myth? These are just some of the questions that we will consider. More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, well be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse.  Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kinds - including politicians, journalists, and scientists strategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed.  Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends.  More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable.  Ultimately, you will conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals."	John Oddo	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A20							
76731	"The Romantics, Religion and Politics"	None	English	"We usually think of the American and French revolutions as primarily political, but they also confronted dominant religious beliefs and generated alternatives ranging from enthusiasm and pantheism to atheism. We will explore the literary and political meanings of religious belief and dissent in major writers like Samuel Coleridge, Thomas Paine, Edmund Burke, William Wordsworth, Matthew Lewis and others who grappled with Protestantism, Catholicism, Dissent, and such interesting extreme alternatives as evangelicalism, enthusiasm, pantheism, and atheism. Two interpretive papers and in-class presentations will be required."	Jon Klancher	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 154A							
76746	Angels and Diplomats: Renaissance Poetry from Wyatt to Milton	None	English	"The starting point for this course is a question at the nexus of theology, politics, and art that no less central to the age of Shakespeare and Milton than it is today: how should power be represented? Biographically, many canonical poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms. What, then, can structures of mediation like diplomacy and angelic intervention tell us about works like Sidneys sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella, Shakespeares Hamlet, or Miltons Paradise Lost? And what can Renaissance poetry tell us about topics such as sovereignty, immunity, license, fidelity, automation, and accommodation? The course will include introductory and contextual readings from Genesis, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham. Assignments and class discussions will be occasions to practice historically-informed criticism; to compare conceptual structures within seemingly distinct domains of history and thought; and to articulate major fissures and changes in Renaissance angelology, diplomatic practice, and literary craft."

76752	Listening Spaces	12	English	"The proliferation of portable as well as computerized audio technologies has radically changed the way the human beings listen, consume, and produce music and sound. With the emergence of cloud storage services like Dropbox, Amazon, and Google you can effortlessly store and share music files anonymously or with friends.  Services like Facebook, Pandora, Spotify, Last.fm, Amazon, and iTunes use finely tuned algorithms to make musical recommendations and in the process further personalize your experience as a consumer of music.  All of these services, many of which are virtual, have come to mediate our intensely personal and communal experiences with music. The Listening Spaces seminar seeks to understand the overwhelming impact these mediating technologies have had on our social, political and personal interactions with music.  Foundational readings will include Jonathan Sternes MP3: The History of a Format, Alexander Galloways Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture,  Trebor Scholzs Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory. The seminar will be focused around developing and completing critical projects that cross technological and humanistic boundaries."	Richard Purcell<>Richard Randall	2<>4	1500	1620	PH 126A							
76760	Literary Journalism Workshop	9	English	"Literary Journalism is non-fiction writing about the people and places in the world that might be overlooked by traditional journalism. Concerned more with those whose lives are outside of the traditional spot-light, literary journalism enriches our sense of who inhabits the contemporary world. Reading the stories of other lives can help us understand our own, by enlarging and deepening the context in which we understand our humanity. In this class, you will read a variety of professional literary journalism, and be asked to write your own. You?ll have chances to interview people you know, and don?t know, and write their stories, along with an assignment that invites you to capture your family history. You?ll write about Pittsburgh places, and you?ll learn how the stories of your own life can become literary journalism when you learn to contextualize them, and connect them to larger issues. The concerns and goals of Literary Journalism overlap with memoir, creative non-fiction, and magazine writing. The class is run as a seminar and demands high level of student involvement."

76761	Topics in Digital Humanities: Corpus Rhetorical Analysis	None	English	"This course investigates methods for analyzing rhetoric as it mainly exists in digital environments (e.g. blogs, newsgroups, homepages, political sites, Facebook and so on). The focus will be on verbal rhetoric, but students who wish to analyze visual rhetoric interactively with verbal rhetoric will be welcome to do so. In the first part of the course, we will review various methods for analyzing digital texts descriptively (viz., concordance, collocate and keyword analysis) and inferentially, through multivariate analysis (e.g., manova, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis). To learn these methods, in the first half of the course, we will use simple textual data sets supplied by the instructor. In the second half of the class, students will choose their own digital environments to analyze and they will be expected to write publishable-quality rhetorical analyses of these environments. To meet this expectation, students will need to do considerable background research in the digital environments they are studying."	David Kaufer	1<>3	1500	1620	SH 212							
76773	Argument	None	English	"This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of argument. The course begins with an overview of major theories of argument followed by consideration of a variety of topics in argument production, analysis, and evaluation, often applying the principles we study to specific cases in class. Students will each select a type or genre of argument-whether academic, practical, professional, or otherwise-upon which to focus their research throughout the course. Students will begin by developing short assessments of the value and relevance of major theories of argument to the type of argument they are researching, then develop their own approach to argument analysis and apply it to an example of that type of argument, before producing an original argument of the type they have been studying by the end of the course."

76778	Literacy: Educational Theory and Community Practice	None	English	"Literacy has been called the engine of economic development, the road to social advancement, and the prerequisite for critical abstract thought. But is it? And what should count as literacy: using the discourse of an educated elite or laying down a rap?  Competing theories of what counts as literacy and how to teach it shape educational policy and workplace training. However, they may ignore some remarkable ways literacy is also used by people in non-elite communities to speak and act for themselves. In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy-its history, theory, and problems-we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach. Then we will turn ideas into action in a hands-on, community literacy project, helping urban students use writing to take literate action for themselves. As mentors, we meet on campus for 8 weeks with teenagers from Pittsburghs inner city neighborhoods who are working on the challenging transition from school to work. They earn the opportunity to come to CMU as part of Start On Success (SOS), an innovative internship that helps urban teenagers with hidden learning disabilities negotiate the new demands of work or college."

76785	Introduction to Discourse Analysis	None	English	"Discourse analysis places a primary focus on how things are said; and this close attention to the details of language in use can offer insight into a variety of questions posed by researchers across the humanities and social sciences. In this course, we will examine the way discourse is itself a form of social action that plays a fundamental role in organizing social, cultural, and political life. In addition to becoming familiar with a variety of approaches and topics in the study of discourse, a major aim of the course is for you to develop the tools and skills needed to analyze actual discourse data. This will involve learning how to read transcripts and transcribe data at different levels of detail, learning how to ask questions about the data based on different analytic interests, and developing a vocabulary of scholarly terms and concepts that will allow you to comment on discourse features as you formulate interesting and persuasive claims. The first part of the course will involve assignments with shared data to develop fundamental skills. In addition, seminar participants will be responsible for selecting pieces of discourse for mini data sessions throughout the semester. For the final assignment, you will choose and analyze a piece of spoken or written discourse of interest to you. In the end, you should come away from the course with an ability to think critically about the way discourse operates in the world."	Barbara Johnstone	1<>3	1030	1150	CFA 102							
76789	Rhetorical Grammar	9	English	"This is a course in the grammar that characterizes relatively formal, relatively planned, written English.  As we develop and/or review a vocabulary for talking about the structural choices that are available to writers of English, we will practice analyzing and constructing sentences and parts of sentences.   The course is meant for people whose professional plans include writing or editing."	Mary Glavan	1<>3	900	1020	PH A19C							
76790	Style	9	English	"In classical rhetoric, style is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write - coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance - can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising your own writing and the writing of others.  Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?"	John Oddo	2<>4	1030	1150	SH 220

76795	Science Writing	None	English	"This course will teach students how to write clear, well-organized, compelling articles about science, technology and health topics for a general audience. Students will learn how to conduct research on scientific topics using primary and secondary sources, how to conduct interviews, and how to organize that information in a logical fashion for presentation.  For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firms marketing staff.   Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit.  Students will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles -- and rewriting them after theyve been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science. Students should expect to see their writing critiqued in class, in a process similar to what journalists routinely go through. The goal will be clarity and verve; the ethos will be mutual learning and enjoyment."	Mark Roth	2<>4	1030	1150	WEH 4625							
76797	Instructional Text Design	9	English	"This course focuses on the planning, writing, and evaluating of instruction of various kinds, especially instructional texts. It is particularly appropriate for professional and technical writers, but also a good option for anyone interested in fields that involve substantial instruction, such as teaching or employee training. In the first part of the course, well examine the recent history of instructional design and the major current theories. Then well take a step back and study the concepts of learning upon which these theories are based, with particular attention to their implications for how instruction is structured. Youll find that different learners (e.g., children, older adults) and goals (e.g., learning concepts and principles, learning to apply principles to solve novel problems, learning a complex skill, learning to change ones behavior, etc.) require different types of instruction. In the second part of the course, well look in detail at models of how people learn from texts and what features (e.g., advanced organizers, examples, metaphors, illustrations, multimedia) enhance learning under what circumstances. We will study and analyze particular types of texts. Some possible examples include an introduction to the concept of gravity; a tutorial for computer software; a self-paced unit in French; adult educational materials in health care; a workshop on sexual harassment in the workplace; or a unit to train someone how to moderate a discussion. We will also look at various methods (concept mapping, think-aloud, comprehension tests, etc.) that are used to plan and evaluate instructional text. You will do a project, either individually or in a small group (2-3), in which you design, write and evaluate instruction."	Christine Neuwirth	1<>3	1200	120	WEH 5316							
76798	Research in English	None	English	"In this course we will explore methods of researching, writing, and presenting original work in English Studies.  The field of English Studies is profoundly interdisciplinary. We will strive to understand not just traditionally used methods (such as text analysis), but also more recent developments borrowed from other disciplines (such as history and sociology, anthropology, and visual studies). We will cover methods for developing topics, constructing research plans, finding and using scholarly sources and conducting field research, organizing, writing, revising, and presenting a research paper of 20-25 pages.  Throughout the semester, students will develop and work on an original research project. At the end of the semester, students will give a public presentation of their research to other students and English faculty. This research paper can serve as a writing sample for PhD program applications, as a conference paper, or even journal submission."	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1200	120	PH 125B

76820	The Cognition of Reading and Writing: Introduction to a Social/Cognitive Process	None	English	"Understanding reading and writing as a social/cognitive (i.e., a socially situated thinking, feeling, problem-solving) process reveals some of the conscious and unconscious work behind the ways readers comprehend and interpret texts, and the ways writers construct and communicate meanings through them.  To gain insight into the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts. Turning then to writers, we will examine the key processes, from interpreting the task, to planning, revision and meta cognitive awareness on which expert and novice writers differ.  You will also learn a set of process tracing methods for tracking these problem-solving strategies as you do two case studies. One will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a set of readers actually interpret (construct the meaning of) a text you choose. The second will be an extended case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.  Here you are likely to uncover old unconscious habits and problems you had to solve, as well as successful strategies, which will give you new reflective insight into your own thinking as a writer."

76824	"The History, Theory & Practice of Writing Instruction"	None	English	"This seminar, known informally as the pedagogy course, focuses on the intersections of institutional history, writing studies, and learning theory. We explore the history of English Departments with a focus on writing instruction and examine contemporary frameworks for teaching writing as well as the theoretical assumptions and material conditions on which these assumptions are based. We will be concerned with questions such as these: What are the goals and purposes of courses in writing? On what assumptions about learning and the nature of writing are they based? How are they influenced by history and by institutional and material conditions? How do they get translated into methods for teaching writing? And what methods work best for which purposes? What do we know about the effect and effectiveness of such methods? What are the central issues in writing instruction at the college level today? Well examine these questions from a range of perspectives and also gain experience analyzing and constructing the major components of any course: grounding principles, course design, methods, and evaluation.  Students may choose different options for the final project, depending upon students interests and prior knowledge. For some, youll develop both an overall design and the major components of a writing course (or a course with a substantial writing component) intended for a specific institutional context. Others might develop a literature review and research proposal for investigating one of the issues raised throughout the semester."	Danielle Wetzel	2<>4	1200	120	BH 255B							
76830	Greatest Hits from the Medieval World	12	English	"Some stories never go out of style. Much of what we will read in this course was popular throughout Europe, and all of it is still widely retold and enjoyed in various media: for example, Beowulf, Decameron, and Dantes Inferno in film, Tristan in opera, Malorys Morte DArthur in lots of formats. We will consider the medieval telling of these tales and others from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries. Anglo-Saxon, French, German, Italian, and some Middle English texts will be read in translation, but Chaucer and Malory in edited versions of their writers idioms. A particular emphasis will be placed on personal subjectivities to counter the rumor that individual selfhood began with Shakespeare (the inventor of the human, according to Harold Bloom). Some of our texts are reflective, some are outrageous, some are charming, some are funny; all are populated by human beings we can recognize in spite of the unfamiliar styles in which they are presented. Learning outcomes include a sense of both the historical conditions for storytelling and the ways tales can take on new meanings over time.   Graduate students will be responsible for reading additional historical and critical materials and writing longer papers than undergrads."	Peggy Knapp	1<>3	1500	1620	BH 255B							
76838	"The Wire: Crime, Realism, and Long-Form TV"	12	English	"The HBO series The Wire (2002-2008) has been called the greatest TV show ever. Part of the first wave of quality television series by which HBO changed the way people conceived of the artistic possibilities of the medium, the Wire differed from its contemporaries like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in its realism and its smaller audience. Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling long-form TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be binge-watched. The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.    This course will consider the wire in the context of realist fiction of the 19th century, twentieth-century crime fiction, earlier TV crime series, and other long-form TV, including Mad Men. We will try to explore The Wires realism, its continuing appeal, and its impact.  We will probably watch 3 seasons of The Wire."	David Shumway	3	1830	2120	BH 255B							
76851	Language and Globalization	12	English	"It is a paradox of globalization that the same factors that cause people to become more alike also make people become aware of difference.  In this course we explore this process with respect to language.  We look at the history of language standardization and its relationship with political and economic history, exploring when and why different ways of speaking and writing become more alike, both as an automatic result of social interaction and as a planned result of policy.  We look at the language ideology that gives rise to and undergirds standardization and the rhetoric that gets used to forward it.  Then we explore reasons for and mechanisms of localization in language. What ideas about language, communication, and identity underlie attempts to push back against standardization, and what rhetorical strategies forward these ideas? We then turn to three case studies: arguments about Global English versus local Englishes and ways of using English, ongoing struggles over the standardization of the Putonghua variety of Chinese in China and the development of regional and national standards in Taiwan and elsewhere, and the history of Catalan, a regional dialect that has become a quasi-national standard in the Catalunia region of Spain.  In addition to presenting and leading discussion on two of the readings, students will be expected to complete two 500-word writing assignments and undertake a substantial original research project that expands on one or more of the themes of the course.  This project will be presented orally and in a 20-25 page paper."	Barbara Johnstone	1<>3	1500	1620	WEH 5328							
76855	Performance Theory	None	English	"Emerging from anthropology, semiotics, theater studies, and cultural studies, the interdisciplinary field of Performance Studies offers new ways for practitioners in the field of literary and cultural studies to interpret texts and visual artifacts, as well as media and theater productions. This course will introduce key theories of performance and celebrity by writers such as Richard Schechner, Diana Taylor, Joseph Roach, and Judith Butler, and give students experience in using these analytic frameworks to study a range of objects, from print texts to visual images and even ephemeral performances. While performance is key to how humans make meaning across all times and places, the uses of performance and the forms of celebrity vary historically, and we will ground our theoretical studies in case studies drawn from the early modern British and 20th century American entertainment cultures.  Celebrity is a very modern phenomenon that first became a visible part of political, religious, and artistic culture over the course of the long 18th century, between 1660 and 1800.  We will investigate the genealogies of modern celebrity, considering such questions as, what do the Kardashians have to do with dead English kings?  What can cross-dressing actresses teach us about 21st-century drag performances?"	Kristina Straub	2<>4	1330	1450	HL 106C							
76856	Class and Cultural Studies	None	English	"In the 1990s the holy trinity of American cultural studies was race, class and gender. While race and gender have remained potent themes for cultural analysis, the place of class in cultural studies is not as clear. So the key question in this course will be: how should work in cultural studies incorporate questions of social class going forward? We will start with theoretical texts by Gramsci, Marx, David Harvey and others. After this opening unit, we will then survey a few works that offer models for how to combine the study of class with the study of culture, including John Russo and Sherry Linkon, New Working Class Studies and White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America. We will also read The Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls."	Kathleen Newman	1	1830	2120	BH 255B							
76858	The Sociology of Literature and Media in the 20th and 21st Centuries	12	English	"This course introduces the sociology of literary, media, and other cultural texts with special emphasis modern systems or fields of cultural production. We will take up these issues in two phases:  1940s to 1970s, and 1980s-2000s.  The first half of the course will explore twentieth-century theories of culture and their implications for literary and media texts (from the Frankfurt School to literary and film theory of the 40s-70s). Then we will ask how this kind of theory (Marxism, structuralism, and others) was revised or rethought since the 1980s with respect to the rise of both neoconservatism and neoliberalism.  These terms have a bearing on both what we study (the canon debates provoked by neoconservatism) and the institutional context in which we learn the humanities (the market promoted by neoliberalism, the university, and related institutions). We will try to determine where the humanities may stand now in terms of these cultural, political, and economic contexts. Readings in Adorno, Benjamin, Jameson, Bourdieu, Luhmann, Arrighi, Harvey, Latour and others.  One short paper and one research paper will be required."	Jon Klancher	2	1500	1750	BH 145C							
76863	Contemporary Rhetorical Theory	None	English	"This course offers an introduction to various contemporary theorists whose works are frequently studied and employed by scholars in our field, as well as a systematic and historically informed study of how rhetorical inquiry frames research questions and devises a conceptual course of study. Among the issues we will want to tackle are: a) the demise of rhetoric and its subsequent contemporary revival, with the role played by modernity and postmodernity in this process; b) the relation between contemporary rhetorical theory and its tradition; c) rhetoric as a theory of verbal action. The foci of the course will be major figures in the field, as well as more controversial representatives of contemporary rhetorical theory: Chaim Perelman, Kenneth Burke, Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, Jurgen Habermas, and others. Students will write three papers: a review of the main journals in the field, a research proposal, and a research paper addressing a question of significant relevance for rhetoricians on the contemporary arena."

76872	Multimedia Storytelling in a Digital Age	9	English	"This course explores the craft of journalism in the context of the history, traditions and glory of journalistic nonfiction in the United States. It seeks to help you hone your writing and thinking skills as you produce pieces of substance that reflect those traditions and standards. As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism?s glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print. Students will be given assistance and encouragement as they seek outlets for their writings and connections in the media world that could lead to internships and employment."

76875	"Law, Performance, and Identity"	None	English	"Although rhetoric and law have long been closely associated, the modern professionalization of law has often promoted the idea that legal discourse is not rhetorical but is a rigorously defined technical discourse that can be applied free of social or political influence. This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the importance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal discourse, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. In this course we examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses constitute identities in global contexts, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War politics influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law in order to garner international support. Alongside primary sources of legal discourse, we will study a selection of interdisciplinary scholarship about the relationship of rhetoric and law."	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A22							
76887	Web Design	12	English	"As the Internet has increasingly become an integral part of professional and technical communication in all organizations, writers entering the workplace are expected to have a broad range of web design skills to complement their expertise in writing and design for print. Thus, we?ve designed this course to help writers learn the broad range of skills needed to develop communication materials that are tailored for the web. In particular, the course focuses on the planning, design, and testing of the visual and verbal content typical of contemporary websites. As a member of the class, you?ll participate in a guided, semester-long web design project, which is scaffolded with a series of group and individual assignments. The project begins with an introduction to user-centered methods for understanding the audience (users), where you will learn and practice foundational user-centered design methods through readings and a series of hands on exercises, including interviews, and observation of actual users. You will also learn theories and methods for developing effective information architecture, including organizational schemes, navigational design, labeling, form design, and visual design. Working in groups with other students, you will, over the course of the semester, develop a prototype of a small website, which will be evaluated through user testing at the end of the semester. While we focus primarily on the activities described above, we?ll also discuss sound and animation, emerging technologies such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, and social media."

76889	Advanced Document & Information Design	12	English	"This course builds on the foundational visual design skills introduced in 76391/791 Document  Information Design, and provides students with opportunities to further develop their skills through a series of larger and more complex document and information design problems. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are essential parts of this course. Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be used to complete the assignments."

76892	Rhetoric of Public Policy	None	English	"In traditional public policy approaches, each step of the policy process from defining a problem to making a case for its solution is assessed in reference to rational models of economic and political actors. This course, however, takes a less conventional rhetorical approach to public policy which focuses attention on the values, beliefs, and argument structures associated with issues as a means of assessing them and as a method for moving forward with effective arguments towards their resolution. Towards this end, we will be studying the theories and analytic methods of both classical and modern rhetoric as well as modern public policy theory. Over the course of the semester, we will combine knowledge and techniques from both fields to examine the development of the public policy debate over the safety and efficacy of nuclear power as a solution to the current environmental and energy security challenges faced by the United States. No previous experience with public policy or knowledge about nuclear power is necessary for this course. Those with experience are welcome."	James Wynn	2<>4	900	1020	PH A22

79185	Grand Challenge Interdisciplinary Freshman Seminar:  Racism	9	History	"Racism is everywhere in the twenty-first century. In August 2009, the renowned Indian actor, Sharukh Khan, was detained at Newark International Airport. According to Khan, his Muslim surname led American immigration officials to question him about the nature of his visit for over two hours. Was his treatment racist? In 2011, Luis Suarez a Uruguayan soccer player was punished for allegedly calling French footballer Patrice Evra negro in England. But was the word negro, said in Spanish, racist?   Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it. What are the historical origins of racism? How is racism reproduced? How does race influence identity formation? Can racism produce positive identities? Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion?   This course will examine racism in Pittsburgh, in the United States, and in several other countries and regions throughout the world. We will approach racism from multiple academic perspectives with a team of three faculty from the departments of History, English and Modern Languages. This team-based interdisciplinary approach to Freshman Seminars draws on several departments and guest speakers."	Nico Slate<>Mariana Achugar<>Richard Purcell	2<>4	900	1020	PH A18A

79200	Documenting the 1967 Arab-Israeli War	9	History	"This course introduces students to methods and materials that historians use to study the past. Its goals are: first, to familiarize students with ways that historians think about their research, how they carry it out, and how they debate findings with other historians; second, to train students in best practices for doing historical research in primary and secondary sources. We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Fall 2016 semester, we will use the topic of World War I to focus the class. In the Spring 2017 semester, we will use the topic of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Work includes reading and discussing a variety of sources; completing short assignments such as primary document analyses, response papers, and reports related to students research topics; occasional oral progress reports to the class, and outlines or drafts. There is a final 10-15 page research paper."	Laurie Eisenberg	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A19D

79206	Crime and Punishment in Early Modern Europe	6	History	"This mini course will examine early modern European legal institutions and their role in defining and enforcing societal norms of conduct and belief. We will focus especially on how shifting definitions  of crime and punishment within the period reflected prevailing societal attitudes and anxieties toward perceived acts of deviance and persons on the margins of society. Assigned readings will examine early modern  European criminal court systems, investigation and punishment of crime, and criminalization of social deviance (witches, vagrants, religious minorities and other outcasts)."

79208	"The Early Modern Witch-Hunts, c. 1400-1700"	3	History	"Between the late 15th and the early 18th centuries, many Europeans became convinced that their society was threatened by a conspiracy of diabolic witches.  Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and diabolism dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the most intense campaign of witch-hunting in all of Europes history. Before it was over, the Great European Witch-Hunt of the early modern era cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its American colonies. Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period and why - seemingly just as suddenly - Europeans ultimately came to repudiate them.  This course examines the phenomenon of the early modern witch-hunts in both their European and colonial contexts, focusing on the origin and rationale of early modern witch beliefs and the factors driving the timing and intensity of witch-hunts, the patterns of accusations, and the ultimate end of the prosecutions.  Throughout, we will examine the many regional variations in witch beliefs and prosecutions that make the early modern witch-hunts such a complex historical puzzle.  In the process, we will explore how early modern witch-hunting reflected major issues in European society, culture, and politics -- including the relationship between popular and elite culture; religious reform; the formation of the modern state; gender and patriarchy; and the rationalization of law, medicine, and science."

79213	"The American Railroad, Past & Present"	6	History	"Railroads in the USA are often considered as a subject for nostalgia or public sector failure, an image largely based on passenger service. However, the USAs private sector freight rail industry is considered a model for the world as the result of its renaissance following deregulation in 1980. This is a stealth industry whose history and economics are both intertwined and complex.   Starting with the development of the first U. S. railroads, students will gain a basic understanding of the industrys history and economics, with special attention to the past half-century. In addition, students will participate in small group research projects in particular areas of special interest -- for example, economic history, industry culture, network economics, utility regulation or transportation policy."

Then they struggled to shape a new political order.  Entangled in the US-Soviet Cold War, postcolonial states sought the favor of one side or the other.   At the same time they experimented with capitalism or socialism.  Everywhere Africans aimed at a better material life.   Join us to examine these exciting events through primary sources and books and articles by leading scholars."	John Weigel	1<>3<>5	1030	1120	PH 225B

A wide range of topics will be addressed, such as: race, ethnicity, and indigeneity; state formation and politics; national identity and the politics of memory; migration and the border; and the drug war.    Students will discuss historical and anthropological scholarship on Mexico, but will also consider cultural documents of various kinds, like Mexican music, art, and food."

The British Empire operated as a vast  network of people, institutions, commercial interests, and commodities that fueled Britains rising geopolitical importance and made London the financial capital of the world through the First World War.  Often relying on the power of the Royal Navy, the Empire incorporated far-flung territories into this web of interconnectedness and unleashed what we now call globalization.  Using the writings of historians, as well as primary sources such as newspapers, travel accounts, letters, and literature, Global Empire will follow the development of the British Empire from the sixteenth century to its demise after the Second World War.  We will pay particular attention to the way Britains economic interests shaped its imperial project. Thus, the course will explore topics such as colonial commodities, slavery, imperialism, naval power, free trade, and war in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and the British Isles. Ultimately, students will not only be able to recognize and assess the role of the British Empire in the development of globalization, but will also be able to identify the ways that economic interests shape state policy in the world we live in today."

79234	Technology in American Society	9	History	"This course explores technological change and innovation in the United States in broader political, social, cultural, and business context. Questions of how technologies developed concurrently with the American experience from the late eighteenth century to the present will drive classroom discussion, examination of primary documents and technological artifacts, and theoretical exploration of change over time. Strong focus is given to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as products of a longer historical narrative."	Andrew McGee	2<>4	1200	120	PH 226A							
79235	Caribbean Cultures	9	History	"This course will examine the cultures and societies of the Caribbean focusing on their colonial past, their current positioning in the world, their social structure, cultural patterns and current transnationalism. Using social history, film and music we will explore the topics of race, class, family, gender, religion, national identity and underdevelopment. Comparative research projects will provide concrete instances of the differences and similarities between the Anglo-Caribbean, Franco-Caribbean, and Hispanic Caribbean. This course is open to all students."	Shawn Alfonso-Wells	2<>4	900	1020	PH 226B							
79237	Comparative Slavery	9	History	"The past few years have seen a proliferation of major motion pictures about enslavement, particularly Django and Twelve Years a Slave.  They have all depicted enslavement in the context of the US South.  This course will examine the enslavement of Africans and people of African descent from a comparative perspective, investigating labor organization on rice, sugar, cotton, tobacco, and indigo plantations, gender, class, as well as the experiences of enslaved children in the Americas, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa.  Students will learn to critically read and analyze secondary sources, conduct independent research in primary sources.  We will also view and discuss different representations of enslaved societies in popular media, including film."	Benjamin Reilly	1<>3	1630	1750	CMB 2052							
79239	"The Great Depression in America, 1929-1941"	6	History	"Until the Great Recession of 2008, it had become virtually unthinkable that the United States would ever again experience a financial downturn coming close to that which followed the stock market crash of 1929; and we likely still havent.  Lasting for more than a decade, the Great Depression affected American life and culture in ways that were both pronounced and profound. This course looks at the multiple and complex manner that American life changed in the decades between the two world wars. It assesses social, cultural, political, economic, and technological changes that, in the midst of deprivation and economic uncertainty, ultimately brought modernity to everyday American life.  Relating to the Great Depression itself, students will evaluate varying political approaches to the complex financial and social issues wrought by economic downturn, comparing and contrasting Herbert Hoovers local and regional relief focus with Franklin Roosevelts massive, federally-funded New Deal initiatives. In addition, students will analyze first-person narratives from everyday Americans describing their day-to-day experiences.  Finally, the course will explore how the Depression became a near-constant cultural focus in this era, reflected in popular movies, music, and works of fiction."

79255	Irish History	9	History	"This 6-unit mini course surveys Irish history from the earliest human settlements until the present day, with emphasis on the period since the sixteenth century. Our main objective is to understand the sources of conflict in modern Ireland. In order to do that, however, we look at a number of topics such as the role of religion in Irish society; the causes of population growth, movement, and decline; changing forms of protest; and the formation of rival myths of the Irish past and its meaning."

79262	Modern China: From the Birth of Mao ... to Now	9	History	"[Note: students who have already taken this course under its former title 79-262, Modern China, may not enroll.]   This course is an introduction to major themes in twentieth-century Chinese history, including the transition from empire to nation, revolution, social change and modernization, western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of the party-state, Chinese socialism, economic liberalization and the so-called Chinese Dream.  The first half of the class is devoted to the period between the fall of the imperial system and the founding of the Peoples Republic of China (1911-1949).  If the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and development of the socialist state are to be considered in historical context, it is necessary to first understand the political, cultural, economic and intellectual currents that immediately preceded them. During the second half of the course, we will examine the Maoist period (1949-1976). We will investigate the Chinese Communist Party as both a state-building institution and an engine of social transformation, and consider the tensions these dual roles produced.  Finally, we will look at the Reform Period (1978-present), and reflect on a newly robust Chinas attempts to come to terms with its own recent past and what the consequences might be for both China and the world."

79264	Tibet and China: History and Propaganda	6	History	"[Note: students who have already taken this course under its former title 79-264, Tibet in History and Imagination, may not enroll.]   This course is an introduction to the Tibet Question, the dispute over whether Tibet should be part of China, an independent nation-state, or, as the current Dalai Lama now advocates, something in between. History often serves as the battleground on which competing visions of the nation are fought - who should be included and excluded, where natural boundaries begin and end. This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The Tibet Question is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between China and Tibet from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the Tibet Question have constructed historical narratives (propaganda) in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the Tibet Question may hold for understanding other outstanding historical disputes."

German troops quickly reached the hills above Moscow, surrounded Leningrad in the longest running siege in modern history, devastated the countrys economy, and slaughtered millions of Soviet civilians.  Over 26 million Soviet citizens died in the war.  Eventually, the Red Army came back from defeat to free the occupied territories and drive Hitlers army back to Berlin. Using history, films, poetry, veterans accounts, documentaries, and journalism, this course surveys the great military battles as well as life on the home front.  It highlights the rise of fascism, the Stalinist purges of the Red Army, and the Nazi massacres of Soviet Jews, peasants, and partisans. Occasional required evening film screenings."

79275	Introduction to Global Studies	9	History	"Globalization is a familiar term that is often used to invoke the idea that places around the world are rapidly becoming more interconnected. This is so, but it is also true that this is far being from a simple or harmonious process. Rather, globalization involves a wide range of uneven and disputed cultural, political, economic, and social developments that often influence one another but vary markedly in their significance, impact, and intensity. Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and militant ethnic, religious, and nationalist movements are just as much a part of the contemporary global landscape as are technological innovation, instantaneous communication, shifts in the global division of labor, the creation of new wealth and knowledge, the promotion and defense of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values and perspectives. This course introduces you to important ways of thinking about globalization and will acquaint you with the kinds of research, evidence, and information upon which these kinds of thinking rely. It serves as a foundation for further study of the contemporary world in advanced Global Studies courses."	Paul Eiss	1<>3	900	1020	DH 1211							
79281	Introduction to Religion	9	History	"Religion can be viewed from the outside, through the academic lenses of history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, etc., and from the inside, listening to the experiences and reflections of those who practice various faiths. The course will examine major religious traditions from several perspectives, and begin to explore such topics as the relationship between religion and science, faith and reason, and religion in public life. For students with a general interest in religion as well as those contemplating a religious studies minor."	James Gilchrist	1<>3	1330	1450	GHC 4101							
79283	Hungry World: Food and Famine in Global Perspective	9	History	"The science and technology of the Green Revolution in the second half of the 20th century were heralded as a miracle. Agricultural science promised seeds, peasants, companies, governments, scientists, economists, exporters, and planners would work together to support growing populations, especially in the post-colonial world. The human population on Earth reached six billion before the end of the second millennium; seven billion were estimated around 2011. The United Nations predicts eight billion by 2025.   Awareness of living in this unique period of human history brought new debates among scholars, practitioners, and planners thinking about the critical role of agriculture and development on Earth. How can we conceptualize, hope, and plan for best possible outcomes for a human population that depends on agriculture and development? How has the legacy of the Green Revolution encouraged (or betrayed) public enthusiasm for innovative fixes?  This interdisciplinary course will use methods and case studies drawing on History, Historical Demography, Anthropology, Cultural Studies, Regional Studies, Geosciences and Agricultural Sciences, and International Economic Development. If students wish to pursue a particular thematic or regional interest, there will be room in this course to explore particular cases in depth."	Abigail Owen	2<>4	1200	120	DH 1117

People leave their mark on the natural world, and create artificial environments, in ways deeply tied to culture, practice, and experience. Over the past 150 years, archaeologists have developed many effective methods for studying the past. How can we better understand people by exploring the physical world in which they lived? How we can evaluate competing interpretations of the past? This seminar course will critically review the research history of, research methods in, and current problems and issues in archaeology."

As is well known, America has become a land of great religious diversity, and Islam in particular. Appreciating this issue helps appreciate the dynamism of the US and the religion of Islam. To a degree, however, this is both an old and new phenomenon. The course will explore the many facets of Islamic history and life, the process of its growth as well as the challenges and issues that American Muslims of different colours and backgrounds face in a vibrant plural democratic  society."

Inward Odyssey will explore world history by examining it through the outward-looking eyes of travel writers, on the assumption that travelogues, though supposedly written about the other, in fact provide crucial insights about the mindset of the culture that produced them, and often serve as a vehicle for cultural self-exploration or even self-criticism. In terms of content, this course is intended to overlap with World History, Islam and the European World, and US-Arab Encounters. However, this course is intended to be a skills course, designed not to teach students about specific historical periods, but rather to give students the tools they need to conduct their own critical explorations into the historical past."

79302	"Drone Warfare and Killer Robots: Ethics, Law, Politics, and Strategy"	9	History	"Unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly referred to as drones) have become a central feature of the United States global counterterrorism strategy since September 11, 2001, and autonomous weapons systems (which some critics call killer robots) are increasingly being used in conflict and law enforcement. According to proponents, drones and autonomous weapons systems are much safer than manned systems (because there is no operator to be injured or killed), so accurate that they can be used to target individuals and detect threats in real time, and efficient and inexpensive enough to be used for long-term surveillance and protection missions around the globe.  According to critics, the use of such systems is often highly problematic because it is illegal to target individuals outside of formally declared war and because autonomous weapons systems can obfuscate historically accepted chains of military/police accountability and responsibility. Further, in the context of drone warfare, hidden costs are underreported in the mainstream media (including high civilian casualties, the intense psychosocial trauma inflicted upon communities that experience drone strikes, and the psychological impact on drone operators who witness the damage they cause through a computer monitor thousands of miles away).  This course will evaluate these issues through the lenses of law, ethics, politics, history, and military strategy. The final project will involve crafting policy recommendations on drone warfare and autonomous weapons systems (both for military and law enforcement use) to the new president."

This course surveys the development of-and resistance to-such tools by grounding them in the recent cultural history of the United States. Focusing on baseball, medicine, and the law, well explore how and why Americans have come to believe mathematical and computational methods can solve complicated problems, even in seemingly unrelated moral, political, and social domains. The course encourages students to think critically about the wider implications of these transformations by situating their development historically."

We will consider the impact of religion on domestic and foreign policy in selected Middle Eastern countries and communities, the role of religion in fueling conflicts, the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism, the challenge and opportunity this presents to the United States, and the potential for religion to help advance Middle East peace. We will take advantage of the unprecedented upheavals roiling the Arab world since 2011 and use contemporary social media to contact people on the ground in the states we are studying to produce updates as to where religion and politics seem to be intersecting at this time."

79314	The Politics and Culture of Memory	9	History	"What is the relationship between an individual person and collective memories? How do societies remember? This course proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the relationship between memory and history. It explores various ways in which societies have mobilized their remembrances of the past for political and economic ends in the present; how and whose memory began to matter in a global 20th century; and how individual testimonies have highlighted the role of body, experience, trauma, and nostalgia for writing new, more inclusive and heterogenous histories.  We will analyze how the politics of memory intermesh at a local and global scale, via a set of case studies that focus on: the use and erasure of the past in post-1945 Western and Central Europe; political violence, civil war, and reconciliation in post-1990 Guatemala; and the role of remembrance and testimony for claims of moral retribution in the aftermaths of colonialism (the Mau Mau in Kenya).  The course is organized as a discussion-based seminar. The requirements include: mandatory attendance, one in-class presentation on a course topic, weekly discussion questions/comments submitted through CMU Box, and two essays based on the class readings (9-10 pages each, double spaced)."

It investigates both well-known struggles for womens equality--including the battles for womens voting rights, an Equal Rights Amendment, and access to birth control--and also explores the history of lesser-known struggles for economic and racial justice.  Because women often differed about what the most important issues facing their sex were, this course explores not only the issues that have united women, but also those that have divided them."

From early constructions of moral opprobrium, criminal deviance or medical pathology, the LGBT community emerged in the twentieth and twenty-first century as a political constituency and a vital part of contemporary society.  Students should be aware that this course will necessarily address issues of intimate relations and sexuality as well as broader historical issues."	Timothy Haggerty	2<>4	1200	120	BH 237B							
79328	Photographers and Photography Since World War II	9	History	"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.  This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences.  In Spring 2017, students will be expected to make one or more visits to photography exhibitions on view in Pittsburgh (locations to be announced at the first class in January.)"

This course takes a topical approach to the history of American womens health in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in order to understand why womens bodies have been such heated sites of struggle. It covers topics such as the history of contraception, abortion, menstruation, sexuality, female anatomy, rape, domestic abuse, menopause, pregnancy, and childbirth. It explores how American culture has constructed these issues over time, while also examining womens organizing around them.  This course is open to all students."

79335	Drug Use and Drug Policy	9	History	"This course examines the use of psychoactive drugs in American history, as well as medical, scientific, and policy responses to that use. Drugs we will consider include alcohol, heroin, marijuana, tobacco, and cocaine. We will examine changing theories of addiction, ethnographic studies of drug using groups, and the cultural meanings of drug use. We will also consider drugs as commodities in international trafficking. Although the primary focus is on the U.S., we will look at policy approaches to drug use in other countries as well, to put American drug policy in a comparative perspective."

79349	The Holocaust in Historical Perspective	9	History	"How should one approach the Holocaust?  Multiple perspectives are possible, but in this course we will consider not only  fundamental questions related to the Holocaust- Why the Jews? How did  the process of destruction unfold? How could the perpetrators do what they did? Did the Jews go like sheep to the slaughter, etc.- but we will look at the role of non-European actors, particularly the United States.  How did the US respond to events in Europe?  What was the role of President Franklin Roosevelt?  Does America bear any guilt for what happened?   We will try to meet with at least one Holocaust survivor and consider the Holocaust in an age of genocide and murderous fanaticism."	Barbara Burstin	2<>4	1500	1620	PH A22							
79350	Early Christianity	9	History	"In this course we examine the origins of Christianity. Although we deal with biblical as well as other contemporary materials, the approach is not theological but historical. We want to understand how and why Christianity assumed the form that it did by examining its background in the Jewish community of Palestine, its place in the classical world, its relationship to other mystery religions of the time and certain variant forms (now known as Gnosticism) which it assumed prior to the crystallization of orthodoxy."

Energy procurement and expenditure in the US and climate change have been surprisingly linked over the nations entire. Now is the time for CMU students to understand these relationships historically, technically and scientifically, and politically and geopolitically. The course is structured around the reading and discussion of landmark scholarship on energy and climate sewn together by lectures, films, and various unorthodox pedagogical methods."

79361	"Historical Diversities in Islamic Experience: West Africa, ca 800-1591"	9	History	"This course is offered only at Carnegie Mellons campus in Qatar.  Islam, according to a writer, is a religion for the entire world, East and West, Arab and non-Arab; and in the early seventh century, its land began with zone of Arab groupings of different hues belonging to different tribes who spoke different dialects. Many of these groups and others rallied to the call of Islam in the time of the Prophet in the early 600s and of his successors later on. Diversity, an important sign of the Islamic world, has survived in later Muslim societies. This course will focus on this process of diversity within unity, as Clifford Geertz advocated in his important Islam Observed.  Islam emerged in Mecca and Medina in the seventh century C.E., spread in Christian- ruled North Africa and gold- producing Niger Valley of sub-Saharan West Africa.  The Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula witnessed a religious change, mostly from the influence of the Byzantine Empire (Greek-Christian part of the ancient Roman ire), the Persian or Sasanian or Zoroastrian Empire. Multi-culturalism of some sort characterized this world, as many texts will show."	Lansine Kaba	1<>3	1500	1620	CMB 1031							
79364	"The Birth of Modern Childbirth, 1600-Present"	6	History	"At-home births, epidurals, C-sections: womens experiences with childbirth vary widely. Many of these differing experiences stem from societal developments that occurred in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Amidst these changes, the ritual of childbirth was transformed. Women went from giving birth at home with a midwife, surrounded by female friends and relatives, to giving birth in a hospital with male obstetricians.   This course asks students to identify the factors (e.g., human agents, ideologies, etc.) that influenced major changes in the childbirth process, and to examine how these changes affected women of the time. Additionally, students will be asked to consider what implications historical study holds for interpreting contemporary debates surrounding womens health issues, including but not limited to childbirth.  Throughout this course, we make liberal use of primary sources to develop arguments about the large-scale changes that occurred between 1600 and the present. Through assigned readings, class discussions, and diverse course assignments, students will develop an informed perspective on the transformation(s) of childbirth."

79368	Rebellion! Ancient Greeks to Modern Times	9	History	"Rebellion is a fundamental aspect of human existence. Descartes declared: I think therefore I am. We might say that over the course of the twentieth century this formula became: I rebel therefore I am. Relying on historical and philosophical analysis, this course will examine the preconditions and events that led to this transformation. We will consider how violence, revolution, utopian thinking, and the relationship between individuals and institutions inform our understanding of rebellion. The philosophical history of rebellion stretches from the Ancient Greeks (the Cynics) through to the 19th and 20th centuries in the works of Marx, Bakunin, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, Adorno, and Marcuse. Over the course of the semester we will explore the philosophical underpinnings of rebellion by reflecting on anarchism, nihilism, and dialectical processes."

It encompassed daring experimentation with prevailing cultural forms and content. Poets, writers, painters, and musicians rebelled against traditional conventions to create a new and exciting avant garde, which nurtured a new erotic sensibility.  This course focuses on the erotic aspects of Russian cultural production in this period, including the link between eroticism and decadence. We will explore the literary and philosophical texts of leading writers, poets, and philosophers.  We will study the eroticism of the Silver Age within its larger European context, examining its relationship to Freudianism, as well as prominent new ideas about death and history."

Kennedy as a lens to understand the United States of the early 1960s. How JFK came to be elected, his actions while in office, and his legacy inform our understandings of elements as diverse as the presidency, elections and campaigning, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, the War in Vietnam, the Space Program, relations between the government and the private sector, the nature of public figures as celebrities, popular fascination with assassinations and conspiracy theories, and broader transformation of American culture during a tumultuous decade.

How do information technologies shape an emerging information society, and vice versa? How do the technological innovations, limitations, and quirks of computers reflect and shape the broader context in which they emerged? Particular attention will be given to the earliest decades of computing and the deep history of contemporary information technologies."	Andrew McGee	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 237B

Digital mapping and GeoLocation technologies influence our everyday interactions and perceptions of the world around us. Historians are thinking about how these technologies can change their fields of study, too.  Through the spatial turn in the Humanities and Social Sciences, historians are using spatial experience to think more deeply about the meaning of place and space. Visualizing spatial relationships via new technologies can offer meaningful new ways to approach historical questions. This course will consider viewpoints from the discipline of Geography and explore the impact of new methods in the Digital Humanities, including the impact of digital tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS)."

79411	Research on Great Islamic Issues According to the Early Sources	9	History	"This course is ONLY offered at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar.  The term Islam suggests centuries of history that embody a creed and a civilization with unity and diversity in its rituals and politics. The Islamic world involves great questions that differentiate Muslims from one another. Examples include the Shia-Sunni schism or split that has divided Islamdom since the first decades after the death of the Prophet founder in 632; the tensions between unity and sectarianism that relentlessly explode in Muslim countries; the persisting questions of equality and inequality that pertain to gender and race. The works of such historians as Muhammad ibn Ishaq of Medina (704-769), who authored an early biography (Sirat Rasul Allah, Life of the Messenger of Allah), Muhammad ibn Saad of Basra (764-845), who was inspired by Ibn Ishaq, the historian Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923), who authored the multi-volume Tarikh al-rasul wa al muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings),and the 14th-century eminent thinker, Abu Zayd Muhammad Ibn Khaldun, who wrote the Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History, and numerous contemporary scholars help to elucidate part of the problems. Exploring these texts improves the students grasp of history.  This course will be taught as a proseminar that aims at introducing the literature in the English translation and at raising questions.  It will broaden deepen the appreciation of history by undergraduate students. As a specialized offering reserved for students minoring in history or having successfully completed two courses in history or having the authorization of the instructor."

79424	History of German Film	9	History	"This course is a chronological introduction to one of the worlds greatest cinema traditions: German cinema.  It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywoods greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitlers so-called Third Reich, when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final weeks of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.  No knowledge of the German language is required for this course; most of the films will be in German with English subtitles.  The course will be cross-listed in the departments of Modern Languages, English, and History.  Students will be required to attend class, to watch all of the required films, to actively participate in discussion, to write a 15-page term paper on a topic related to German cinema history, and to take a midterm and a final examination."

Hes the cyber outlaw who we imagine can take down the powerful with the click of a finger, sometimes serving as an agent of the Russian government, at other times threatening the state itself. This course will examine the mythology and reality of the Russian hacker by tracing its prehistory, from anarchists in Imperial Russia, to Bolshevik revolutionaries, to dissident artists of the Soviet Union, and finally to contemporary heretics such as Pussy Riot and Edward Snowden. The course will culminate in a student-led symposium on the sociocultural role of the Russian hacker.   This course follows a seminar format. Students will be required to critically analyze literature, film, and historical documents. They will work on written exercises that prepare them to write a research paper to be presented at the symposium. This is a 9-unit course. For those proficient in Russian, however, a total of 12 units can be earned by conducting some portion of the work in Russian and meeting outside of class for some additional hours. Details are to be worked out in advance, in consultation with the instructor."	Tatyana Gershkovich	2<>4	1500	1620	PH 226B

During the first semester of the seminar, students define and refine their topics, familiarize themselves with the main primary and secondary sources they will need to write a good paper, and complete significant research in both kinds of sources, resulting in a paper of about 30 pages, not including endnotes or bibliography.   They should aim for a paper in which 40 of the references are to primary sources.  We expect that students will devote the summer between the two semesters of the seminar to research in archival or other primary source material either in Pittsburgh or in archives in other places.

We will begin with a brief introduction to the core theoretical concepts of expertise, objectivity, power, professionalization, trust and witnessing.  We will then cover a variety of topics, including: the growth of a class of expert statisticians, engineers, and economists to advise rapidly expanding bureaucracies in the 18th and 19th centuries; efforts by scientists and physicians to control human reproduction, and improve public health, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the role of scientists and development specialists in reformation of agriculture and rural life from the 1930s to the 1970s; the rise of various forms of expertise around environmental issues since the 1960s; and finally, the increasing influence of algorithms and autonomous decision-makers in our lives. These topics will be examined from a variety of geographic contexts.  Requirements for this course include a research paper that relates to the students existing scholarly interests, producing weekly reflections on the assigned readings, consistent attendance, and regular participation in class discussions."

Accordingly the course is divided into three sections. In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why."

Topics impacted include: the nature of intelligence, our status as separate individuals with a unique identities, the structure of human knowledge, the nature of certain human rights, e.g., the rights to privacy or to ownership of the products of work, the values we place on social interactions and relationships, and what constitutes a free marketplace of ideas.  This seminar will explore living in and with the various features of the cyberspaces that now permeate and, in part, constitute our lives.  Topics will include consciousness and intelligence (both human and machine), life in computer simulations (Are we living in one?), ethical issues created by or intensified in cyberspace, and the effect of cyberspace on living a good life.   We will explore together the implications these new dimensions of human experience have on our understanding of the world and on our beliefs on how we choose to live our lives."	Joel Smith<>David Danks	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 150							
80110	Nature of Mathematical Reasoning	9	Philosophy	"This course focuses on understanding the principles and problems at the root of mathematical reasoning; it is not a course on any specific mathematical theory, like linear algebra or topology. We will explore the foundations of mathematics, both in terms of their historical origin and their modern purpose as a base for the study of mathematics. Then we will see how problems which seem to have no intuitive solution look simple after being put in the right mathematical form, but also consider the limitations this type of approach. We will treat such issues as they arise both in applied fields (policy decision-making, physics, computer science) and as more recreational, speculative and abstract (Conways game of life, the works of Escher, music). The course is aimed for students at the freshman and sophomore level who do not necessarily intend to pursue a mathematically intense major."	Samuel Speight	1<>3<>5	1230	120	DH 2210							
80135	Introduction to Political Philosophy	9	Philosophy	"As an introductory course, we will seek to trace out the historical and philosophical dimensions of the polis from its origins in Ancient Greece to its current manifestation in present-day society. Special emphasis will be placed on the concept and practice of democracy.  Well begin with the history of political philosophy from Plato and Aristotle (two of the early critics of democracy) to the modern period and the arguments in support of republicanism as found in the Federalist Papers (Madison, Jay, Hamilton). These historical moments cast light on the philosophy behind the development of the US constitution. Following Ketcham, well discuss the debate between the ancients and moderns, enlightenment ideas regarding liberty and equality as well as the distinction between private rights and public goods.  After presenting some fundamental justifications for democracy and our current models of democratic governance, well study the basic political frameworks of our day through a thorough-going analytic analysis of the writings and arguments of recent and contemporary political philosophers such as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Robert Nozick, Charles Talyor, Michael Sandel, and Annette Baier. The course will end with a discussion of the theory and practice of deliberative democracy and a chance for students to engage in this model of democracy through the activities of an ersatz deliberative poll."	Derrick Gray	1<>3<>5	1030	1120	DH 1209							
80136	"Social Structure, Public Policy  & Ethics"	9	Philosophy	"The course will consider ethical questions surrounding social structure and public policy. It will analyze the role of political institutions and individual citizens in dealing with some of the greatest challenges facing our world: Global health crises, the spread of (and threats to) democracy worldwide, and world poverty. Some of the questions we will consider include: Are developed countries obligated to ameliorate poverty by providing foreign aid? What is democratic governance, and what do democratic representatives owe to their constituents? Should wealthy nations and corporations assist in the fight against life-threatening diseases worldwide? The course uses ethical and political theory, case studies, and empirical evidence to consider these questions."	Daniel Malinsky	1<>3<>5	1230	120	SH 208							
80150	Nature of Reason	9	Philosophy	"This course offers an intellectual history of philosophical views regarding the nature of human reasoning in mathematics and the sciences, from ancient to modern times. The first part of the course traces the search for deductive methods for obtaining certain knowledge, starting with Aristotle and Euclid, and continuing through the Middle Ages and late Renaissance thought, to the work of Boole and Frege in the nineteenth century. The second part of the course considers the history of skepticism about empirical knowledge, covering Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Descartes, Pascal, and Hume, along with replies to skepticism in the works of Bayes and Kant. The third part of the course discusses theories of the nature of mind, culminating in the computational conception of mind that underlies contemporary cognitive science."	Peter Spirtes	1<>3	1230	120	PH 125C							
80180	Nature of Language	9	Philosophy	"Language is used to talk about the world or to describe it, but how do we go about describing language itself? Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description.   The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them.   Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language."	Thomas Werner	1<>3	1230	120	BH 136A							
80210	Logic and Proofs	9	Philosophy	"This web-based course introduces students to central issues in logic and develops their ability for constructing and refuting arguments. It addresses the question: How can one analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material."	Mate Szabo	5	1230	120	SH 219

80221	Philosophy of Social Science	9	Philosophy	"This course will explore various philosophical issues germane to social science. The central question of the course asks whether we can use traditional scientific tools to understand social phenomena, e.g. wars and religions, in the same way that we use them to understand natural phenomena, e.g. gases, lasers and planetary orbits.  Some of the more specific questions we address: Because humans possess free will and act with intentions while light rays and planets in motion do not, are we forced to use logically different species of explanations in the two cases? How can we explain social institutions that depend upon cooperation? Whereas natural scientists actively conduct experiments, social scientists can often only collect statistical data. Does this difference prevent social scientists from inferring causal relations? Is our understanding of social phenomena always value laden?"	Joel Smith	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 225B							
80230	Ethical Theory	9	Philosophy	"Every day, even in very subtle ways, we make judgments of value that shape our lives and our conduct. This course will examine four influential attempts at providing a systematic account of the source and nature of moral value, its relationship to other kinds of value, and the practical implications of different answers to these questions. This focus on the fundamental structure of moral value will frequently engage topics such as the nature of the good, subjectivist and objectivist accounts of value, forms of moral naturalism verses attempts at moral constructivism, and will draw on historical as well as more contemporary  sources. Particular attention will be paid to articulating the specific sources of disagreement that distinguish competing moral theories in order to facilitate our ability to adjudicate between them on a reasoned basis."	Alex London	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 125B							
80242	Conflict and Dispute Resolution	9	Philosophy	"Conflict is an intractable feature of human life, whether occurring between family members, friends, coworkers, political organizations, nations, and even within oneself. You must then be prepared to negotiate with others to get your job done, to advance your career, and even to maintain meaningful personal relationships with your family and friends. The purpose of this course is to help prepare you for these negotiations. In particular, in this course, you will reflect on your current approaches to conflict, study the nature of conflict and why it tends to escalate, and develop your own skills for principled negotiation. Throughout the course you will also participate in negotiation simulations exercising your powers of communication and persuasion while practicing conflict resolution tactics. My goal is that you finish this course a more reflective and effective negotiator, better prepared to handle the conflicts you will inevitably face."	David Gray	1<>3	1330	1450	CMB 1031							
80243	Ethics of Leadership	9	Philosophy	"From business operations to international affairs, leadership concerns the use of power or influence to coordinate a group towards common purpose. However, leadership also requires the acceptance of responsibilities not shared with the other groups members. Given their distinctive role and responsibilities, leaders must be prepared to face a unique host of moral problems and dilemmas. In this course, we will pursue the question of what makes a morally good leader, as opposed to a merely effective one. To that end, we will critically examine various competing theories of leadership while considering the moral challenges that arise when power, self-interest, justice, and the collective good collide."	David Gray	0<>2	1630	1750	CMB 1031							
80245	Medical Ethics	9	Philosophy	"This course provides an introduction to core ethical issues in health care, medical research, and public policy. Topics include: the moral responsibilities of health care providers to patients and various third parties such as the government or insurance companies, the status of health as a social good, and questions of individual liberty and social responsibility at the ends of life including issues such as abortion, physician assisted suicide, and the definition of death. We will also examine specific ethical issues in the conduct of medical research and look at the impact of technological innovation on our notions of health, disease, life, death, and the family. If time permits, we may also discuss issues related to genetics and cloning. While the course engages such substantive ethical issues it also attempts to sharpen students skills in practical reasoning through argument analysis, analogical reasoning, and the application of theory and principles to particular cases."	Alex London	2<>4	1330	1450	PH 125B							
80248	Engineering Ethics	9	Philosophy	"This course provides an introduction to core ethical issues in engineering research and practice. Topics include: the moral responsibilities of engineers to clients and various third parties such as the government or insurance companies, conflicts of interest, whistleblowing, codes of ethics, and the status of engineering projects as social goods. While the course engages such substantive ethical issues it also attempts to sharpen students skills in practical reasoning through argument analysis, analogical reasoning, and the application of theory and principles to particular cases. This course meets two days a week and employs a case study discussion format during class."	Maralee Harrell	1<>3	1500	1620	PH 225B							
80251	Modern Philosophy	9	Philosophy	"Descartes project to doubt all received knowledge and begin from scratch marked the beginning of an intellectual upheaval, helping to launch what is now called the Modern period of philosophical thought; the Western world is today the heir of modernism. Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant are several of the most important figures of this period. We will examine works of these thinkers, exploring both the new sorts of questions that these philosophers raised and their new methods of doing philosophy, which together mark a fundamental break with the traditions that preceded them. We will devote special attention to the new theories of knowledge they proposed and to their works in ethics and political philosophy. The philosophical revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries occurred during a time of great scientific progress and political upheaval in Europe; as part of our course we will consider the relation of certain of these developments to the new questions and methods of the modern philosophers and to their works in ethics and political philosophy."	Robert Cavalier	2<>4	1200	120	BH 235B							
80253	Continental Philosophy	9	Philosophy	"This course provides students with an overview of key movements in European Philosophy. The historical background covers Descartes, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. The central tenets of phenomenology and existentialism (e.g., intentionality, Being-in-the-World, Bad Faith) will be discussed in the context of selected works from Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. The course will conclude with the background for and current work of Habermas."	Robert Cavalier	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 235A							
80280	Linguistic Analysis	9	Philosophy	"At one level, language is constituted by nothing but sounds, or marks on paper. How can such physical objects be used to create or transmit meaning? The answer assumed in this course is that objects with specific physical features are assigned symbolic or linguistic values on the basis of those features. By the juxtaposition of such objects (phonemes or graphemes), larger symbolic objects are created (morphemes). Morphemes have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on. The goal of this course is to investigate the structure of the linguistic entities by which these communicative functions are realized. Building on material taught in Nature of Language, we look in detail at the morphology and syntax of human languages, paying special attention to cross-linguistic variety."	Thomas Werner	1<>3	1500	1620	DH 1217							
80287	Historical and Comparative Linguistics	9	Philosophy	"This course provides an introduction to the study of language change. The languages we speak are always changing: over time, these small changes can accumulate into more significant ones, making it possible for very different languages to derive from a common linguistic ancestor. These observations immediately raise a number of questions. Which kinds of changes occur in the history of human languages? How can linguistic theory help us to make sense of these changes? What can we infer about the historical relationships between languages, and about unattested ancestors of known languages? In this course, we will explore techniques for addressing these questions, learning about some major themes and tendencies in sound change, grammatical change, and semantic change."	Benjamin George	2<>4	1500	1620	SH 208							
80292	Learning Science Principles	6	Philosophy	"The ability to learn - that is, to change and adapt to ones environment - is one of the hallmarks of intelligence, whether in humans, animals, or machines. In this course, we will examine the nature, components, and significance of learning in many different manifestations, with a particular focus on the fundamental concepts that underlie the ways in which we understand the concept of learning in different disciplines. This course will thus focus more on concepts and foundations, rather than technical aspects of learning, whether mathematical, experimental, or computational. This course will be almost entirely project-based: you will work in groups (with students from different backgrounds) to identify opportunities for learning media, and then develop designs that appropriately address those opportunities. In the course of developing these media designs, you will learn, and come to understand, concepts and principles of learning from different disciplines. The emphasis throughout will be on careful conceptualization, description, and design of the learning through and about media.  To waive an IDeATe portal course requirement, students should have prior project-based coursework in design, social science research methods, or interactive prototyping experience."	David Danks	2<>4	1030	1150	HL 106C							
80311	Undecidability and Incompleteness	9	Philosophy	"U  I focuses on two fundamental results: the undecidability of logic (established by Church and Turing) and the incompleteness of mathematical theories (discovered by Gdel).  The proofs of these results required not only a novel metamathematical perspective, but also striking logical concepts and fascinating mathematical techniques.  We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.  To understand the latter connections, we will read and discuss also historical and philosophical aspects of the subject."	Wilfried Sieg	1<>3	1030	1120	SH 125							
80382	Phonetics and Phonology II	9	Philosophy	"This course is a continuation of Phonetics and Phonology I (80-282) and is designed to expand upon the phonetic skills developed in that course, while delving more thoroughly into various issues central to phonology.  We will focus primarily on consonants and the phonetic principles that govern their realization, with a special emphasis on voicing.  We will learn about how articulatory and acoustic principles give rise to voicing assimilation, final devoicing and the interaction of consonant voicing and tone. The exploration will be hands on, and we will learn how to measure voice onset time, analyze stop bursts and fricative noise and see how the voicing of a consonant affects the pitch of the following vowel, using Praat.   On the phonological side, we will consider various ways in which voicing contrasts and processes have been represented, including SPE-style binary features, feature geometry and Optimality Theory.  One of the central themes will be how to reconcile phonological accounts of voicing phenomena with our understanding of their underlying phonetic principles.  Both rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology rely on discrete symbols, whether they be phones or features, but the speech stream is not neatly divided into segment-sized units, and the features of phonological theory are typically spread over multiple segments.  Additionally, many phonological explanations recapitulate phonetic principles, calling into question what we consider to be an explanation of sound patterns.  The course will culminate in a survey of some recent approaches to understanding how phonetics and phonology interact."	Christina Bjorndahl	1<>3	1030	1150	DH 4303							
80387	Philosophy of Logic & Language	9	Philosophy	"In this course we examine the nature of logic and language and their relationship to the world and to each other. The class will consist largely in discussions based on a selection of readings. Topics covered will vary between offerings, but may include: truth and meaning, reference, modality, the roles of context and intent in meaning and communication, the suitability or unsuitability of logic as a model of natural language meaning, the notion of logical laws, and the roles of proof, inference, and entailment. Some prior experience with logic, formal semantics, or mathematics is assumed. No background in linguistics is required."	Benjamin George<>Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 226A							
80391	Morality Play: Laboratory for Interactive Media and Values Education	12	Philosophy	"What do you get when you cross cutting edge interactive media technologies with inquiry into the big questions of human existence?  Lets find out  New technologies-including online gaming, interactive film, social media, podcasts and smartphone apps-have enormous potential to change the way people learn.  Especially intriguing is their potential to promote active, exploratory learning.     We have only scratched the surface of this potential.  Imagine interactive technologies that impart a deep understanding of the human condition.  Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity.  Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion.  What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education?   In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue.  Then, instead of producing a term paper, well collaborate with a team from CMUs Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life.  The result will push the boundaries of what is possible in the way of technologically mediated learning."	Andy Norman	2<>4	1030	1150	DH 4303							
80405	Game Theory	9	Philosophy	"Game theory is the study of interactive decision-making: making choices in the context of other agents who are also making choices. Famous examples include the Prisoners Dilemma (pitting rational self-interest against the benefits of cooperation), and the Cournot duopoly (a basic model of market competition and supply-and-demand). Game theory has been applied to situations as diverse as traffic flow, auctions, the search and competition for scarce resources, and bargaining.  This course will develop conceptual and technical facility with the mathematical tools used to model and analyze such situations. We will cover games in strategic and extensive form and games of perfect and imperfect information; well also study solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and rationalizability. Finally, throughout the course we will take the opportunity to actually play several of the games we study to help build intuitions and foster insights into the formal mathematical models we develop."	Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1330	1450	WEH 5409							
80419	Interactive and Automated Theorem Proving	9	Philosophy	"Interactive theorem proving involves using computational proof assistants to verify that mathematical proofs are correct, or to verify that hardware and software designs meet their formal specifications. This course uses a new interactive theorem prover, Lean, to explore this new technology and its logical foundations. We will study dependent type theory, a powerful and expressive language for representing mathematical objects, algorithms, and proofs. We will also consider automated methods that can be used in support of formal verification, including propositional, equational, first-order, and higher-order methods, as well as decision procedures for real and integer arithmetic."	Jeremy Avigad	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A21							
80447	Global Justice	9	Philosophy	"Until recently, the dominant view of international relations has been that the governments and citizens of one country have no moral obligations to those beyond their borders.  With the rapid growth in globalization has come a drastic shift in attitudes about our obligations to those with whom we share global institutions of trade but neither legal systems nor national identities.  This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global distributive justice in the context of a globalized world, with emphases on both theoretical accounts of justice and the practical implications of those accounts for important current issues. Theoretical topics will include the nature of justice, the sources and limits of our moral obligations, and how and whether those notions of justice extend to global society; while applied topics will include our obligations with regard to the environment, human rights deficits, the status of women, and global economic policy."

80513	Seminar on Philosophy of Mathematics	9	Philosophy	"The linguistic turn in twentieth century philosophy lets us think about mathematics as a collection of linguistic rules and norms that helps us reason effectively and make sense of our experiences. The advent of computational proof assistants, which use stylized languages to convey mathematical content, provides new perspectives on these rules and norms. This seminar will explore ways these formal models of mathematical language and inference can be brought to bear on traditional questions in the philosophy of mathematics."	Wilfried Sieg	4	1030	1320	BH 150							
80514	Categorical Logic	9	Philosophy	"This course focuses on applications of category theory in logic and computer science. A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the ambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. In particular we will cover the notion of realizability topos, which is a category theoretic incarnation of the realizability technique from proof theory.  A prerequesite for this course if familiarity with basic category theory (as treated e.g. in Steve Awodeys Category Theory textbook), but depending on demand the course can start with a quick refresher of the central concepts."

Fundamental answers are molecular processes; less fundamental are intra and inter neuron processes; less fundamental still are what the smallest collections of neurons that functional imaging can resolve--voxels-- are doing; and still less fundamental are what collections of voxels are doing.  Doing means what features of the environment the neurons, or clusters of neurons respond to, or what behaviors they produce, or what causal relations they have with one another.  This seminar will focus--not exclusively--on the last, and particularly on how, if at all, those causal connections can be discovered from fMRI time series."	Clark Glymour	3	1330	1620	BH 150

At what point does benefiting from injustice become complicity?  What constitutes contributing to injustice?  How should responsibility for (in)justice be distributed? Covered texts will include Rawls A Theory of Justice, Lepora  Goodins On Complicity  Compromise, Shelbys Dark Ghettos, and Youngs Responsibility for Justice."

80602	Philosophy Core Seminar II	12	Philosophy	"This course surveys contemporary philosophical issues by discussing a different set of journal articles each week. Frequently the discussion focuses on the work of faculty from the department, from nearby universities, or from visiting scholars.  Discussions are often moderated by the person whose work is being discussed.  The course therefore provides an survey of a wide range of philosophical issues and methods and strives to situate more technically oriented work within a broader philosophical context by emphasizing links to traditional philosophical problems, methods, frameworks or assumptions.  The course also provides an opportunity for graduate students to explore potential areas of interest and to foster contact with potential thesis or dissertation advisors.  This course is required for first year graduate students.  Advanced undergraduates may participate only with the permission of the instructor."	Teddy Seidenfeld	1<>3	1330	1450	DH 4303							
80611	Undecidability and Incompleteness	12	Philosophy	"U  I focuses on two fundamental results: the undecidability of logic (established by Church and Turing) and the incompleteness of mathematical theories (discovered by Gdel).  The proofs of these results required not only a novel metamathematical perspective, but also striking logical concepts and fascinating mathematical techniques.  We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.  To understand the latter connections, we will read and discuss also historical and philosophical aspects of the subject."	Wilfried Sieg	1<>3	1030	1120	SH 125

Jeremy Avigad	2<>4	900	1020	BH 150							
80682	Phonetics and Phonology II	12	Philosophy	"This course is a continuation of Phonetics and Phonology I (80-282) and is designed to expand upon the phonetic skills developed in that course, while delving more thoroughly into various issues central to phonology.  We will focus primarily on consonants and the phonetic principles that govern their realization, with a special emphasis on voicing.  We will learn about how articulatory and acoustic principles give rise to voicing assimilation, final devoicing and the interaction of consonant voicing and tone. The exploration will be hands on, and we will learn how to measure voice onset time, analyze stop bursts and fricative noise and see how the voicing of a consonant affects the pitch of the following vowel, using Praat.   On the phonological side, we will consider various ways in which voicing contrasts and processes have been represented, including SPE-style binary features, feature geometry and Optimality Theory.  One of the central themes will be how to reconcile phonological accounts of voicing phenomena with our understanding of their underlying phonetic principles.  Both rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology rely on discrete symbols, whether they be phones or features, but the speech stream is not neatly divided into segment-sized units, and the features of phonological theory are typically spread over multiple segments.  Additionally, many phonological explanations recapitulate phonetic principles, calling into question what we consider to be an explanation of sound patterns.  The course will culminate in a survey of some recent approaches to understanding how phonetics and phonology interact."	Christina Bjorndahl	1<>3	1030	1150	DH 4303							
80687	Philosophy of Logic & Language	12	Philosophy	"In this course we examine the nature of logic and language and their relationship to the world and to each other. The class will consist largely in discussions based on a selection of readings. Topics covered will vary between offerings, but may include: truth and meaning, reference, modality, the roles of context and intent in meaning and communication, the suitability or unsuitability of logic as a model of natural language meaning, the notion of logical laws, and the roles of proof, inference, and entailment. Some prior experience with logic, formal semantics, or mathematics is assumed. No background in linguistics is required."	Benjamin George<>Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 226A							
80691	Morality Play: Laboratory for Interactive Media and Values Education	12	Philosophy	"What do you get when you cross cutting edge interactive media technologies with inquiry into the big questions of human existence?  Lets find out  New technologies-including online gaming, interactive film, social media, podcasts and smartphone apps-have enormous potential to change the way people learn.  Especially intriguing is their potential to promote active, exploratory learning.     We have only scratched the surface of this potential.  Imagine interactive technologies that impart a deep understanding of the human condition.  Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity.  Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion.  What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education?   In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue.  Then, instead of producing a term paper, well collaborate with a team from CMUs Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life.  The result will push the boundaries of what is possible in the way of technologically mediated learning."	Andy Norman	2<>4	1030	1150	DH 4303							
80705	Game Theory	12	Philosophy	"Game theory is the study of interactive decision-making: making choices in the context of other agents who are also making choices. Famous examples include the Prisoners Dilemma (pitting rational self-interest against the benefits of cooperation), and the Cournot duopoly (a basic model of market competition and supply-and-demand). Game theory has been applied to situations as diverse as traffic flow, auctions, the search and competition for scarce resources, and bargaining.  This course will develop conceptual and technical facility with the mathematical tools used to model and analyze such situations. We will cover games in strategic and extensive form and games of perfect and imperfect information; well also study solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and rationalizability. Finally, throughout the course we will take the opportunity to actually play several of the games we study to help build intuitions and foster insights into the formal mathematical models we develop."

80719	Interactive and Automated Theorem Proving	12	Philosophy	"Interactive theorem proving involves using computational proof assistants to verify that mathematical proofs are correct, or to verify that hardware and software designs meet their formal specifications. This course uses a new interactive theorem prover, Lean, to explore this new technology and its logical foundations. We will study dependent type theory, a powerful and expressive language for representing mathematical objects, algorithms, and proofs. We will also consider automated methods that can be used in support of formal verification, including propositional, equational, first-order, and higher-order methods, as well as decision procedures for real and integer arithmetic."	Jeremy Avigad	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A21							
80747	Global Justice	12	Philosophy	"Until recently, the dominant view of international relations has been that the governments and citizens of one country have no moral obligations to those beyond their borders.  With the rapid growth in globalization has come a drastic shift in attitudes about our obligations to those with whom we share global institutions of trade but neither legal systems nor national identities.  This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global distributive justice in the context of a globalized world, with emphases on both theoretical accounts of justice and the practical implications of those accounts for important current issues. Theoretical topics will include the nature of justice, the sources and limits of our moral obligations, and how and whether those notions of justice extend to global society; while applied topics will include our obligations with regard to the environment, human rights deficits, the status of women, and global economic policy."	Derrick Gray	1<>3	1330	1450	DH 1209

80815	Seminar on the Foundations of Statistics	12	Philosophy	"This decision-theoretic seminar is organized in three parts.   1. In the first we examine Savages theory of subjective expected utility, primarily chapters 2-5 of his classic book, The Foundations of Statistics.   2. In the second part of the course, we focus on the following issues:     2.1. A comparison of Savages theory and deFinettis criteria of coherence.     2.2. Personal vs. group decisions. Topics to include: Arrows impossibility theorem, consensus, and Savages position in 7.2  13.5 of his book.     2.3. Contemporary theories that highlight violations of the sure-thing principle -- violations of Savages postulate P2. 3. For the third part, we discuss issues related to Indeterministic and/or Imprecise Probability [IP] theory.  The seminar explores some of the ongoing research programs falling under IP, mostly as reflected in the Society for Imprecise Probability: Theories and Applications (www.sipta.org)."

82185	Freshman Seminar: Racism (Interdisciplinary Team-Taught Seminar)	9	Modern Languages	"Racism is everywhere in the twenty-first century. In August 2009, the renowned Indian actor, Sharukh Khan, was detained at Newark International Airport. According to Khan, his Muslim surname led American immigration officials to question him about the nature of his visit for over two hours. Was his treatment racist? In 2011, Luis Suarez a Uruguayan soccer player was punished for allegedly calling French footballer Patrice Evra negro in England. But was the word negro, said in Spanish, racist?   Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it. What are the historical origins of racism? How is racism reproduced? How does race influence identity formation? Can racism produce positive identities? Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion?  This course will examine racism in Pittsburgh, in the United States, and in several other countries and regions throughout the world. We will approach racism from multiple academic perspectives with a team of three faculty from the departments of History, English and Modern Languages.

82188	Freshman Seminar: The Uses and Abuses of Haiti	9	Modern Languages	"This freshman seminar serves as an introduction to the field of cultural studies, where cultural studies includes history, politics, economics, art (painting, music, literature, film, photography), anthropology, religion, public heath, environmental history, and especially language. Students will engage with the complex and complicated island nation by reading first-hand accounts of the lived experience of Haitians, their struggles, their diaspora throughout North America, and their enduring devotion to their homeland. When most of the world takes the time to consider Haiti, it focuses on soundbites and short video clips featuring the latest natural disaster or the ravages of poverty and crime.  This class, however, digs deeper to discover the many talents and resources of what was formerly called la perle des Antilles. Haiti has been rudely handled by the world since it was founded in 1804 by slaves who fought for their freedom. After throwing off the violent exploitation of its colonial conquerors, the Haitians then found themselves shunned and quarantined by its neighbors, including the United States. This course looks at the legacy left by the transatlantic slave trade and the further damage done by cynical and despotic domestic leaders. In spite of these staggering obstacles, the Haitian people continue to show determination, compassion, and hope for the future in ways that bypass a cynical national government and an apathetic or easily distracted world community. The course professor leads an Alternative Spring Break experience to the Port-au-Prince area in March with members of the campus organization CMU in Haiti. Students in the course have the opportunity to support the organization in different ways on the Pittsburgh campus.

The main focus of this course is on genre films. Popular genres have often been dismissed to be formulaic and commercially oriented, which has hampered our perceptions around the complex ways in which genre cinema has engaged with historical changes. Breaking away from the conventional view, this course reads genre films as an important venue to inquire into sociocultural formations. More specifically, this course takes genre cinema to be a contact zone where a variety of narrative and formal orientations intersect, compete, and negotiate with one another: nationalism and transnationalism, convention and innovation, the traditional and the modern, official memory and counter history, realism and imagination, and so on. This course, in other words, pivots around the ambition to enrich our understanding of the convoluted ways in which popular East Asian film genres have evolved in conjunction with recent social and cultural changes in the region."

Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently.  This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

82428	History of German Film	9	Modern Languages	"This course is a chronological introduction to one of the worlds greatest cinema traditions: German cinema.  It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywoods greatest challenger in the international cinema world.  It then addresses the cinema of Hitlers so-called Third Reich, when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways.  In the final week of the semester, the course will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest.  The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.

82441	THE CORPOREAL TEXT: 19TH & 20TH CENTURY SPANISH CONSTRUCTS OF NORMALCY	9	Modern Languages	"This repeatable course explores the cultures of Spain through a thematic or conceptual focus. Students critically analyze authentic documents through, for example, historical, biographical, filmic, artistic, literary, musical, and theoretical perspectives, while improving and expanding their language skills.     SPRING 2017 This course explores contemporary peninsular texts of corporeal representation - medicalized, personalized, objectified and empowered. In this course, we will explore the Spanish body through the lens of medical humanities and disability studies. The former includes texts created in medical environments and from medical experiences, written by doctors, patients and members of the community. Spain has a rich history of doctor/authors that can provide some level of insight into the narrative of the Spanish medical community. Disability studies, on the other hand, views the body in a non-medical context. Instead of proposing the abnormal body as a medical phenomenon to be studied in a petri dish, these expression of (corpo)reality trace ideas of normalcy as societal constructs. The theme of disability in Spain comes in to play with the wealth of organizations dedicated to disability rights (while also mired in controversy).   The texts will come in the form of advocacy pamphlets, novels written by doctors, fictional (and non) depictions of the medical field, illness, etc., painting and sculpture, and films. This course will prompt us to pay attention to the objectification and abjectification of these bodies and consider that through this awareness must also come understanding the body as a text - not an object - but a text that warrants intricate observation. We will analyze these texts in an effort to understanding the constructions of normalcy. In the end, our analysis will be used to create our own texts."

SPRING 2017: Southern Cone Dictatorships in the Movies (1984-2016) This course explores the Southern Cone dictatorships during the period of the Cold War through their representation in films. The military-civilian dictatorships of the 1970s in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were a period of State terrorism. This violent period resulted in thousands of disappeared people, political prisoners and exiles. These experiences have had a lasting impact in the new democracies. There is still a debate over how to address violations of human rights and how to make sense of the past, so that these events dont happen again. There has been a rich production of movies focusing on this historical period that serves as a document of how the struggles over how to come to terms with a traumatic past have been dealt with by different countries. These films also provide a glimpse of how popular culture serves as a vehicle to construct a social memory of recent history. Through films new generations that did not experience these traumatic events learns about what happened and what it means for particular social actors. We will analyze films from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in order to better understand how these countries have dealt with a contested past. The course will provide students with historical background, theoretical frameworks and analytic tools to approach these cultural productions as documents and discourses about the recent dictatorships."

In particular, the course will focus on the Democratic Peace and why democracies tend to win the wars they enter. We will discuss a variety of explanations for the Democratic Peace, that is, the tendency of democratic states to avoid war with each other. We will also discuss whether democratic states select wars more carefully, the incentives of democratic leaders when engaging in war, and whether domestic democratic structures provide states with war-fighting advantages with respect to military organization. Finally, we discuss a variety of consequences of the different domestic incentives faced by autocratic and democratic leaders."	Andrew Bausch	2<>4	900	1020	WEH 5316

Scholars in this subfield - comparativists - use comparative methods to study the political systems of countries around the world, trying to understand how they differ and why. In this course, we aim to learn about how political systems differ, discuss alternative explanations of why they differ and explore the different observed outcomes of political variations. To do so, in the first part of the course we will examine the core concepts and main theories of the subfield. In the second part, we will examine some of the main themes studied in Comparative Politics, such as the differences between democracy and non-democracies, presidentialism versus parliamentarism, developed countries versus developing countries, types of electoral rules, party systems, social cleavages and political cultures. The discussion will focus mainly on the Americas and Europe, but not exclusively. Students will be required to apply the comparative methods discussed in the course to explore the history, political systems, and current events of different countries."

This course is devoted to the study of how people behave when interacting with other citizens, politicians, and political institutions. We will primarily focus on the behavior of non-elite political actors using examples from the United States, other developed democracies, as well as developing countries. We will address questions such as what influences people to vote or abstain in an election, how people decide between candidates, how trust and cooperation develop within and across ethnic groups, and how citizens respond to political violence and terrorism. The course will integrate game theoretical perspectives with insights from psychology to help students gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between citizens political goals and the political system in which they operate."

84319	U.S. Foreign Policy and Interventions in World Affairs	9	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"This course will discuss the various ways in which the United States, like other countries around the world, tries to influence developments within other states by intervening in their domestic affairs. Interventions of various kinds, utilizing numerous tools, are frequently undertaken by the United States with major effects on the intervened country and subsequent U.S. foreign policy. The goal of this course is to provide a better understanding of such interventions in general and a more complete picture of this frequently neglected aspect of American foreign policy in particular.  Accordingly this course will focus on explaining, among other things, why interventions of various types are done, their effectiveness in achieving their goals and their effects on the target and (occasionally) on the U.S.. It will also discuss in depth various historical cases of American interventions ranging from the early 20th century to the present, widening the depth and breadth of student knowledge on American foreign policy. The course will cover both military and non-military forms of interventions including (for example): Military interventions in civil wars, FIRCs/regime change operations (both the overt and covert types), humanitarian interventions, partisan electoral interventions, economic sanctions, external help in state-building, and drone warfare."

84322	Nonviolent Conflict and Revolution	9	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"Conflict and revolution are usually associated with armed struggle and violence. But over the course of the last century, nonviolent conflict has become an increasingly prominent source of institutional change and political revolution around the world, from Gandhis salt march to Filipino people power to the post-Soviet color revolutions to the Arab Spring. What are the causes, strategies, tactics, dynamics, and consequences of nonviolent conflict, and how do these differ from violent or armed conflict? When and how do unarmed people power campaigns topple repressive authoritarian regimes? This course addresses these questions and in the process engages contending theories of power, revolution, and insurgency. The first half of the course introduces students to key concepts, theories, and historical patterns of nonviolent conflict. In the second half of the course, the class analyzes case studies of landmark nonviolent campaigns, both successful and failed. By the end, students will be expected to write an original 10 page analysis of a particular historical nonviolent conflict, or an intelligence estimate that assesses the prospects for the onset or outcome of nonviolent conflict in a contemporary country."

84336	Implementing Public Policy:  From Good Idea To Reality	12	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"Good public policy doesnt just happen.  Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it.  The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agencys current policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term.  Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted from scratch -- or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures.  Students will then consider a particular sub-specie of public policy, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern them.  The course culminates with students developing and staffing a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system studied throughout the term.  This course may benefit a range of audiences:  students considering government and related policy careers; future business leaders who must set standards for business practices, employee behavior, or operations within the confines of governmental regulations; prospective paralegals and attorneys; or anyone interested in exploring what the rules are and why.

84343	Language and Power: How to Understand and Use Political Speech	6	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"Political writing is a subspecies of language with several manifestations. There is an art to the op-ed and to the editorial, to the polemical essay and to the review.  Within government, there are skills particular to writing speeches and ghosting essays, preparing Congressional testimony and Federal commission reports, and to drafting policy memoranda.  There are even special forms and qualities of expression for hosting award and memorial ceremonies, and for writing thank-you notes, toasts, and letters of condolence.  This course is designed to teach an appreciation for the range and nature of political writing and speech in both its public and governmental forms. It also introduces students to the fundamental skills required to do effective political writing.

Students intern three days per week, for approximately 24-25 hours, in offices from Capitol Hill to the White House and including opportunities in cabinet agencies, nonprofit institutions, museums, advocacy groups, policy think tanks, cultural institutions, and news organizations.  Through the internship, students gain professional experience and make long-lasting professional and personal contacts. In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty for a 2-hour seminar to report and reflect on their internship experiences, and address pressing current issues from the perspective of their internship organization.   In addition, the weekly seminar typically includes 1-2 CMU alumni from the Washington, DC, area. Their personal and professional experiences become part of the seminar conversation, and they make themselves available to students as ongoing sources of information and advice.

Some, like terrorism, are a tactic while others, like insurgency, are a strategy. How important is it to define terrorism and insurgency? What are the differences and similarities between them? This course will go into depth to analyze both terrorism and insurgency and their various manifestations. The course will provide a historical overview of how terrorism and insurgency have evolved over time, while also focusing on groups, methods, ideologies and organizational structures. Is the terrorism conducted by Salafist groups like Al-Qaida and the Islamic State significantly different than that perpetrated by ethno-nationalist groups like the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Tamil Tigers? What are the best methods to counter-terrorism and how successful have states been- both historically and more recently- at combating the threat posed by terrorism and insurgency?"	Colin Clarke	1	1830	2120	GHC 5222							
84402	Judicial Politics and Behavior	9	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"This course is a survey of research and insight into one of the most unique American government institutions: the judiciary. Rather than exclusively reading case law (as one would do in a Constitutional Law class), this course examines court structure, rules of law and, most importantly, judges as actors within an institutional setting. We will focus on how rules, norms, and expectations guide the decisions, actions, and range of options available to judges. Here we will study the nature of judicial decision-making and its antecedents, the organization of the judicial branch and its implications for behavior, and the strategic interactions both within courts and between the courts and the more political branches of government. The course will look at state and federal courts within the United States, supplemented with examples from international jurisdictions. Material from law, history, economics, political science, sociology, and psychology will be introduced throughout the semester. Although some of the literature uses empirical and/or game theoretical models, students are not expected to have mastered these tools prior to taking the course."

84450	Policy Forum	6	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"The Policy Forum course takes a critical look at decision making in domestic politics and US foreign policy.  It does so through weekly roundtable discussions with a diverse set of thought leaders.  Based on intellectually significant essays that students are expected to read in advance of each class, these discussions give students an opportunity to ask probing questions about the three branches of the US government, media, embassies, advocacy groups, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations.  This course seeks to help students understand the responsibilities and activities that leaders and decision makers carry out on behalf of their organizations.  Students are instructed in how to confidently and respectfully ask critical questions of those shaping policy.  The term roundtabling is used to describe submitting an issue for critical discussion among relevant stakeholders.  Knowing how to direct a roundtable is a significant element in the professional development of anyone interested in taking part in the policy arena, and this course helps students hone this important skill.  In requiring students to read  important essays related to each class session and then step back from discussions with leaders to write analytical essays, this course teaches students how to develop strong arguments based on solid logic and credible evidence, an essential component in making democracy work."

84602	Judicial Politics and Behavior	12	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"This course is a survey of research and insight into one of the most unique American government institutions: the judiciary. Rather than exclusively reading case law (as one would do in a Constitutional Law class), this course examines court structure, rules of law and, most importantly, judges as actors within an institutional setting. We will focus on how rules, norms, and expectations guide the decisions, actions, and range of options available to judges. Here we will study the nature of judicial decision-making and its antecedents, the organization of the judicial branch and its implications for behavior, and the strategic interactions both within courts and between the courts and the more political branches of government. The course will look at state and federal courts within the United States, supplemented with examples from international jurisdictions. Material from law, history, economics, political science, sociology, and psychology will be introduced throughout the semester. Although some of the literature uses empirical and/or game theoretical models, students are not expected to have mastered these tools prior to taking the course."

84609	Political Behavior	12	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"The goal of this course is to understand how citizens engage with and influence the political system. This course is devoted to the study of how people behave when interacting with other citizens, politicians, and political institutions. We will primarily focus on the behavior of non-elite political actors using examples from the United States, other developed democracies, as well as developing countries. We will address questions such as what influences people to vote or abstain in an election, how people decide between candidates, how trust and cooperation develop within and across ethnic groups, and how citizens respond to political violence and terrorism. The course will integrate game theoretical perspectives with insights from psychology to help students gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between citizens political goals and the political system in which they operate."

84619	U.S. Foreign Policy and Interventions in World Affairs	12	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"This course will discuss the various ways in which the United States, like other countries around the world, tries to influence developments within other states by intervening in their domestic affairs. Interventions of various kinds, utilizing numerous tools, are frequently undertaken by the United States with major effects on the intervened country and subsequent U.S. foreign policy. The goal of this course is to provide a better understanding of such interventions in general and a more complete picture of this frequently neglected aspect of American foreign policy in particular.  Accordingly this course will focus on explaining, among other things, why interventions of various types are done, their effectiveness in achieving their goals and their effects on the target and (occasionally) on the U.S.. It will also discuss in depth various historical cases of American interventions ranging from the early 20th century to the present, widening the depth and breadth of student knowledge on American foreign policy. The course will cover both military and non-military forms of interventions including (for example): Military interventions in civil wars, FIRCs/regime change operations (both the overt and covert types), humanitarian interventions, partisan electoral interventions, economic sanctions, external help in state-building, and drone warfare."

84622	Nonviolent Conflict and Revolution	12	Institute for Politics and Strategy	"Conflict and revolution are usually associated with armed struggle and violence. But over the course of the last century, nonviolent conflict has become an increasingly prominent source of institutional change and political revolution around the world, from Gandhis salt march to Filipino people power to the post-Soviet color revolutions to the Arab Spring. What are the causes, strategies, tactics, dynamics, and consequences of nonviolent conflict, and how do these differ from violent or armed conflict? When and how do unarmed people power campaigns topple repressive authoritarian regimes? This course addresses these questions and in the process engages contending theories of power, revolution, and insurgency. The first half of the course introduces students to key concepts, theories, and historical patterns of nonviolent conflict. In the second half of the course, the class analyzes case studies of landmark nonviolent campaigns, both successful and failed. By the end, students will be expected to write an original 10 page analysis of a particular historical nonviolent conflict, or an intelligence estimate that assesses the prospects for the onset or outcome of nonviolent conflict in a contemporary country."

Some, like terrorism, are a tactic while others, like insurgency, are a strategy. How important is it to define terrorism and insurgency? What are the differences and similarities between them? This course will go into depth to analyze both terrorism and insurgency and their various manifestations. The course will provide a historical overview of how terrorism and insurgency have evolved over time, while also focusing on groups, methods, ideologies and organizational structures. Is the terrorism conducted by Salafist groups like Al-Qaida and the Islamic State significantly different than that perpetrated by ethno-nationalist groups like the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Tamil Tigers? What are the best methods to counter-terrorism and how successful have states been- both historically and more recently- at combating the threat posed by terrorism and insurgency?"

The course focuses on issues concerning the conduct of war and military strategy, surveying both classic texts and recent works on important security policy issues. The course has three main objectives: (1) to introduce students to the complexities of the relationship between political ends, military means, and the strategy linking the two; (2) to familiarize students with major theoretical perspectives in international security; and (3) to survey key substantive areas and debates in the field, with reference where appropriate to particular case studies.  Questions animating this course include: Why is force used? What causes peace? How does the possibility of war shape international relations and domestic socio-economic arrangements? By what criteria should the use of force be considered legitimate? How can governments effectively prepare to prevent wars, or to win them if they occur? Is the world safer after the Cold War? What are the similarities and differences between inter-state wars, civil wars, and armed conflict between states and transnational actors (such as terrorist groups)?"

This course will serve as an introduction to how peoples psychologyhow they think, feel, and actshapes their experience of race and identity in America. After a brief discussion about the structural and systemic origins of the racial status quo, we will examine the way that individuals navigate the social and racial landscape of modern-day America. Complementing courses that take sociological approaches to race in America, this course will focus on how individuals perceptions and thoughts about the world affect how they interpret and respond to social situations.  For example, the course will address: how stereotypes about ones race or identity can cause individuals to feel threatened, and can undermine health, feelings of belonging, and academic performance  how an individuals concerns about the thoughts and beliefs of others can radically affect identity formation, particularly during adolescence how individuals have to navigate multiple cultural identities, especially as minority group members contending with mainstream ideas that differ from their own how majority group members (e.g., Whites) view their role in racial systems, and how they deal with concerns about being or appearing prejudiced   how interventions can use social psychological concepts to mitigate negative outcomes of racial inequality  We will then use our understanding of these concepts to examine and consider different racial situations thoughout American society and to understand how individuals navigate and experience race and identity. Throughout the course, we will watch films, read literature, and analyze music and art that reflect the experience of race and identity."	Kody Manke	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 336B

Students will learn about basic principles of sound, spatial sound, sound quality, hearing impairment, auditory perception, interactions with other modalities, and auditory cognition. Topics may also include musical acoustics, basic auditory physiology, sound-semantic associations, acoustic analysis, and sound-making gestures. We will consider not only simple laboratory-generated signals, but also more complex sounds such as those in our everyday environment, as well music and speech. Students will gain some in-class experience with generating sounds and analytic listening.  After students reach a sophisticated level of understanding of the auditory fundamentals, they will apply their knowledge to the study of several current issues in auditory research."	Laurie Heller	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 342F							
85395	Applications in Cognitive Science	9	Psychology	"The famous psychologist George Miller once said that Psychology should give itself away.  The goal of this course is to look at cases where we have done so -- or at least tried.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se.  That impact can take the form of a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute. The application should have a theoretical base, as contrasted, say, with pure measurement research as in ergonomics. Examples of applications are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors based on models of cognitive processing, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measurses of consumers implicit attitudes.    The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?  The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students."	Roberta Klatzky	2<>4	900	1020	BH 336B							
85412	Cognitive Modeling	9	Psychology	"This course will be concerned with modeling of agent behavior in a range of applications from laboratory experiments on human cognition, high-performance simulations such as flight simulators, and video game environments like Unreal Tournament.

85414	Cognitive Neuropsychology	9	Psychology	"This course will review what has been learned of the neural bases of cognition through studies of brain-damaged patients as well as newer techniques such as brain stimulation mapping, regional metabolic and blood flow imaging, and attempt to relate these clinical and physiological data to theories of the mind cast in information-processing terms. The course will be organized into units corresponding to the traditionally-defined subfields of cognitive psychology such as perception, memory and language. In each area, we will ask: To what extent do the neurological phenomena make contact with the available cognitive theories? When they do, what are their implications for these theories (i.e., Can we confirm or disconfirm particular cognitive theories using neurological data?)? When they do not, what does this tell us about the parses of the mind imposed by the theories and methodologies of cognitive psychology and neuropsychology?"

Special emphasis will be placed on conditions that are first diagnosed during childhood (e.g., ADHD, Autism, Eating Disorders) as well as understanding how child and adult psychopathology differ. The second half of this course will focus on treatment interventions for youth with psychopathology.  Students will learn about how interventions for adults with psychopathology are altered to be developmentally appropriate for children, and methods of intervention commonly used with children but less so with adults(e.g., family therapy, play therapy). For students who have completed abnormal psychology and the psychology breadth requirement but not the other course pre-requisite, 85102, please see Theresa Kurutz to register for this course in BH 343."

85429	Cognitive Brain Imaging	9	Psychology	"This seminar will examine how the brain executes higher level cognitive processes, such as problem-solving, language comprehension, and visual thinking.  The topic will be addressed by examining what recent brain imaging studies can tell us about these various kinds of thinking.  This new scientific approach has the potential of providing important information about how the brain thinks, indicating not only what parts perform what function, but also how the activity of different parts of the brain are organized to perform some thinking task, and how various neurological diseases (e.g. aphasia, Alzheimers) affect brain activity. A variety of different types of thinking will be examined, including short-term working memory storage and computation, problem solving, language comprehension, visual thinking.  Several different technologies for measuring brain activity (e.g. PET and functional MRI and also some PET imaging) will be considered, attempting to relate brain physiology to cognitive functioning.  The course will examine brain imaging in normal subjects and in people with various kinds of brain damage."	Marcel Just	3	1900	2150	BH 336B							
85436	Scientific Research in Education	9	Psychology	"The most influential piece of education legislation passed in recent years is the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) Most of the public discussion of NCLB has to do with the implications for the way that children are tested and the way that states, schools, and teachers are rewarded. However, this course will focus on what is a more far-reaching, feature of NCLB:  its repeated call for scientifically based education research. NCLB provides an unprecedented opportunity for basic research in the learning sciences to contribute to educational practice. That is the topic of this seminar. Questions we will address: 1. What does scientifically based education research mean?  - Does it mean the sort of CMU-ish studies that cognitive and developmental psychologists do when they are interested in how students think about math or science or reading?  - Does it mean massive national randomized field trials on the effect of class size or teacher training or one curriculum versus another?  - Can it include non-experimental, qualitative, case studies and field demonstrations?  - Must it include new technologies that go beyond traditional teacher-student interactions?  2. What constitutes a treatment or an independent variable: lesson content, instructional method, teacher qualifications, student attributes,      educational ?philosophy?  ?approach? 3. What is the appropriate grain size of the measurements and analyses: individual students, classrooms, teachers, schools, school districts, states, nations?  4. How can research in cognitive science contribute to improving the science of education?  5. Can we point to examples that warrant the label of scientifically based education research, and can such research inform policy and practice in ways that have substantial impact?The course will include readings, discussions, invited expert speakers, and student research projects aimed at an important question about education."

The coverage of material will include a review of historical roots and classic approaches to the scientific study of relationships, as well as exciting new research and theory on particular subtopics.  The majority of class time is spent discussing and evaluating recent research. Special emphasis also is given to learning and critically evaluating the methodological tools that are used to study close relationships.  The goal is for students to leave this course with a broad overview of the field and an in-depth understanding of particular subtopics.      This is an advanced seminar in which students will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.

85795	Applications of Cognitive Science	None	Psychology	"The famous psychologist George Miller once said that Psychology should give itself away.  The goal of this course is to look at cases where we have done so -- or at least tried.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se.  That impact can take the form of a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute. The application should have a theoretical base, as contrasted, say, with pure measurement research as in ergonomics. Examples of applications are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors based on models of cognitive processing, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measurses of consumers implicit attitudes.    The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?  The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students."	Roberta Klatzky	2<>4	900	1020	BH 336B

The class provides an overview of the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of prejudice and discrimination as it pertains to many forms of inequality.  The psychological theories underlying these behaviors will be examined as well as their impact on the lives of stigmatized individuals. Its goal is to examine a number of social differences and understand how prejudice can impact many areas of society. In addition to the traditional forms of prejudice based on such things as race, gender and age; other inequalities that result from less traditional groupings such as social class, appearance, and disability and will be explored.  Research on issues of social identity, intergroup relations and the reduction of prejudice will be examined through readings and class activities."	Chante Boyd	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 336B

88221	Policy Analysis II	9	Social & Decision Sciences	This course is an extension of Policy Analysis I and focuses on a normative analysis of government action. The course begins by considering justifications for government action drawing on work in political philosophy. It then compares different institutional approaches governments may adopt in attempting to correct market failures and in pursuing objectives other than efficiency. The basic concepts and tools of cost benefit analysis are then presented. Students are involved in individual and group projects applying the class material to specific policy issues.

88252	"Causal Inference in the Field: Using Data to Study Crime, Love, Sports & More"	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Causal questions are pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences, and empirical researchers often use regression analysis as a tool for tackling such questions.  This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in real-world settings, not on the mathematical details of regression.  After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses.     Using in-class data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world (e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness) to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked.  The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.  After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging (e.g., do more guns lead to more violence?).    In keeping with the hands-on philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paper/presentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing.  Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper (and accompanying presentation).  The research project makes this course excellent preparation for any student who hopes to ultimately write an undergraduate thesis."	Mark Patterson	2<>4	1500	1620	GHC 4102							
88284	Topics of Law: The Bill of Rights	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"This course examines the history and place of the Bill of Rights in our nations constitutional framework. It focuses on the historical origins of the U.S. Constitution, of each of the first ten amendments to the Constitution (that we refer to as the Bill of Rights), how the meanings and interpretations of these have evolved over time, and what they mean to us today. Each article of the Bill of Rights will be examined in terms of its original intentions, and then through cases that have challenged and been interpreted through the Bills articles."

88302	Behavioral Decision Making	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Behavioral decision making is the study of how people make decisions, in terms that can eventually help them to make better decisions.  It draws together research from psychology, economics, political science, and management, among other fields.  It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems.  The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making.  Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.  The course emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship between theory and application."	Michael Yu	1<>3	1330	1450	SH 219							
88342	The Neuroscience of Decision Making	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Because we are human, feelings provide the basis for reason and rational decision-making.

This course will discuss seminal discoveries in affective neuroscience underlying decision-making."	Linda Moya	1<>3	1200	120	PH A22							
88371	"Entrepreneurship, Regulation and Technological Change"	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"There is a growing interest in understanding the interrelationships between regulatory institutions and innovations. Certainly, opportunities for innovative activities take place in the context of the extant public policy institutions (e.g., entry restrictions in telecommunications, environmental performance standards, intellectual property protections). Consequently, entrepreneurial activity plays a key role in identifying and exploiting these opportunities. In this course, we examine the role that entrepreneurs play in the interrelationships between regulation and technological change.     The objectives are to develop and articulate an understanding of the theory, nature, and role of entrepreneurship in the American economy; the theory, nature, and role of regulation in the American economy; and the theory, nature, and role of the dynamic interaction of entrepreneurship and regulation in the American economy.  Students will evaluate historical cases in which new or changing regulation presents opportunity for entrepreneurial entry in business, as well as historical cases in which entrepreneur activity (in the form of innovation) presents new needs or opportunities for regulation, thereby presenting-or constraining-further opportunities for entry.    The course is broken into a series of blocks, and each week there will be a set of readings posted on Blackboard. Blackboard will be used to facilitate communication, including announcements, readings, lectures, and assignments."	David Hounshell	2<>4	1500	1620	DH 1209							
88380	Dynamic Decisions	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Decisions we make every day may range from simple and routine to novel and highly complex. For example, decisions while driving (judging the distance to the front car, the speed, the directions, and making choices accordingly) seem effortless and routine after some experience, while triaging patients in an emergency room under scarce resources may be quite overwhelming for everyone. Both types of decisions however, have something in common: they are made in the presence of change and in the absence of explicit information of probabilities, possible alternatives, and outcomes. Our decisions in such situations are the result from the interaction between the dynamic environmental demands and our cognitive processes. In this course you will learn how decisions are made in different dynamic situations and how our cognitive processes (e.g., attention, experience, risk tendencies, and other factors) influence the way those decisions are made. Students will be introduced to different aspects of decision processes by analyzing the sources of error in complex problems, such as cases of accidents and disasters (natural or man-made), in multiple disciplines (e.g., aviation, management, military strategy, and others).  The course will also use simulation-based representations of dynamic decision making situations (e.g., microworlds) to illustrate relevant cognitive processes needed for learning, adaptation and choice. Finally, students will learn how to construct mathematical/computational models of dynamic systems, be able to interpret simulation results and to explore scenarios regarding effects of variables in the models and the predictions that the models can make."

88384	Conflict and Conflict Resolution in International Relations	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Course will introduce students to concepts of conflict, conflict resolution, and peace in international relations. Causes of war, alliances, and role of non-state actors in conflict will be examined. There will be also discussion on foreign policy decision making, mediation, negotiation and international law.  The following specific cases will be discussed   the Middle East Peace Process (Security Council Resolution 242, Camp David, Oslo Agreement and Geneva Accord); Indo-Pakistan dispute (Lahore Declaration 1999); War in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Dayton Peace Accords; El Salvador Peace Agreement (between the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional); and the Algiers Agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia.

88413	"Energy and Climate: History, Science, Technology, & Policy in the US 1776-2076"	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"This course provides CMU students with a historically grounded, technically informed, and policy-centered examination of energy and climate in the United States from the American Revolution to the nations tri-centennial, by which time the nation will either have taken the necessary action to avoid massive catastrophes related to global warming or will be destined for-and perhaps already experiencing--a series of vastly catastrophic climate events that visit apocalyptic-like suffering and misery on large segments of the nation.  Energy procurement and expenditure in the US and climate change have been surprisingly linked over the nations entire.  Now is the time for CMU students to understand these relationships historically, technically and scientifically, and politically and geopolitically.  The course is structured around the reading and discussion of landmark scholarship on energy and climate sewn together by lectures, films, and various unorthodox pedagogical methods."

88417	Scientific Integrity and Communication	9	Social & Decision Sciences	"Recently, numerous failures to replicate highly influential scientific findings have raised concerns about whether many scientific claims are true. Several problems have been identified in the way research is conducted and reported that challenge the validity and credibility of scientific conclusions. These threats to the integrity of the scientific enterprise include a variety of common practices in designing, conducting, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting research. In this course, we will discuss these problematic research practices, why they occur, their impact on science and society, and possible solutions to address them. Because discussions of scientific validity and integrity have focused on psychology and biomedicine, many readings will be drawn from these disciplines; however, we will consider the generalizability of these issues across the sciences. This course will be reading, writing, and discussion intensive with a strong emphasis on statistics and research methods."	Stephanie Anglin	2<>4	1330	1450	SH 208

We will do so by first reviewing the basic economics of international commerce, then by examining the complex structure of federal government agencies working on trade and international investment issues. It will outline some of the major trade conflicts, negotiations, and international economic policy debates in which the U.S. federal government is currently engaged. Most importantly, the course will involve students directly in the work of these agencies by allowing Carnegie Mellon students to work on analyses and background research connected to a current policy issue. This undertaking will involve direct connection with U.S. federal policymakers."	Lee Branstetter	1<>3	1330	1450	HBH 2008

It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems.  The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making.  Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.

90823	Program Evaluation	12	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results."

90824	Cost Benefit Analysis	6	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate limited resources.  Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.  Learning Objectives  Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:   Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.   Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.  Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others.  Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics.  Communicate the results of the cost-benefit analysis to stakeholders in such a way as to facilitate political or administrative processes.  Prerequisites  Students must have completed EITHER 90-709 Intermediate Economic Analysis OR 90-710 Applied Economic Analysis, as well as 90-711 Empirical Methods."

90827	Economics of Development	12	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"The purpose of this course is to build an understanding of key economic problems that face developing countries. In the first part we will focus on general models of growth and development. This will include a look at growth theory, structural models of development and more recent innovations in thinking about growth. In the second part of the course we will concentrate on specific, mostly domestic problems of economic development. These challenges include poverty and income inequality, agricultural and rural development, the role of human capital, credit and finance, and health and nutrition. The final section of the course will deal with the challenges faced by developing countries in an increasingly global context. This will include issues of trade, macroeconomics and international finance. The course will mix theory with empirical analysis. In addition to traditional economic analysis of development problems, we will also spend time examining insights from two more recent perspectives - institutional economics and the methodological approaches of randomized controlled trials (so-called field experiments). We will also include brief case studies as a means of testing our analytic knowledge against the complexity of reality."	Olutayo Fabusuyi	1<>3	1500	1620	HBH 1005

90833	Population Health	6	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"It is a societal imperative that we improve the quality of health for all Americans while reducing the cost. In so doing, we must move from a reactionary, disease driven, hospital-dominated model to one that creates the appropriate level of incentives and health delivery infrastructure so that patients embrace strategies to prevent disease and promote healthy living and behavior. What is Population Health and what role do individuals, executive branch agencies, and non-profits play in the protection and promotion of positive health outcomes? How are health outcomes assessed?  In this introductory course, we will examine the way health care delivery systems, public health agencies, community-based organizations, and many other entities work together to develop interventions to improve the health outcomes in the local, national, and global communities they serve. We will first learn to examine health issues from a population health perspective."	Harold Safferstein	4	1800	2050	HBH 1007							
90834	Health Care Geographical Information Systems	12	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical data, social services, and patient data. Public health and medical research agencies are also using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of communicable and infectious disease.  This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It imbeds learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes a lecture and computer lab that focuses on a health care issue which uses ArcView GIS from ESRI, Inc. to analyze data or solve a problem. Through weekly assignments and project case studies students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning.  By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health care organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health related data.

90839	Policy Topics: Global Health Diplomacy	6	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"This course undertakes a strategic leadership approach in training students to lead effectively in a fast-paced, highly demanding policy environment. By integrating the students past coursework and work experience with the courses chief frameworks and assignments, the student will build fluency in leadership skills exercised by practitioners heading major organizations.  The courses chief teaching engine is to introduce the notion of strategic craft, or the purposeful configuration of actions and assets that lead to desired outcomes meaningful to stakeholders. A professional craft is animated by systems of thought which embody accumulated knowledge and conventional wisdom encompassing the major dynamics of a trade or specialty. Systems of thought are encapsulated as frameworks that act as templates, or blueprints, for assessing situations and for organizing lines of action. As tools for analysis, frameworks help to distill the complex into separate, simpler components that are more easily understood. As templates for forward action, frameworks help to provide a recipe in marshaling assets and personnel, sequencing their deployment, and determining essential objectives."

90843	Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Econ Dev	3	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"Economic development is driven largely by funding and financing opportunities. Nearly every redevelopment, business expansion, community facility and infrastructure project hinges on the availability of affordable, patient and flexible capital. When addressing sustainability in economic development, funding and finance are even more critical. The lack of funding and finance can result in the ability for projects and programs to move forward in an effective manner. From the bedrock tools like bonds and targeted tool like tax increment to tax credit investment and access to capital lending programs, the development finance toolbox provides financing options that cover the entire development continuum. Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Economic Development will explore the intersection of development, sustainability and finance with an in depth review of the financing tools that catalyze and drive job growth and economic expansion. This course will not only explore the tools behind effective development but also examine success projects and programs that are driving communities towards a sustainable future.

Students will learn about a big idea with the potential to change the management model that has organized schooling for more than a century. Theyll be exposed to research and reform efforts happening right here at CMU to apply brain science to improve how we teach and learn, and to anticipate ways that technology could facilitate new ways of organizing the experience of school. Then theyll unpack these ideas to identify their potential implications, and anticipate how the benefits and costs would likely be distributed. They will develop solutions to improve the potential effect on the human condition, mitigating the risks and maximizing the benefits across many stakeholders, including those who have been historically marginalized and disadvantaged.  As part of the experience, students will be challenged to apply the skills they are learning in their courses, and will experience facilitation techniques they are likely to find useful in their own careers whatever field they ultimately pursue.   The course will meet for two fun and intense days - February 18 and 19, 2017.

90852	High Reliability in Healthcare	6	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"Health care in the United States is largely delivered in systems of care that are complex, inefficient, error prone, and costly. There currently exists a high degree of variability in the delivery of care between providers and settings of care. Other industries outside of health care have been successful at reducing inefficiencies and eliminating waste through the standardization of processes. High reliability in Healthcare is a 6-unit mini course that will provide students with insight into the unique aspects of the health care environment and the necessary skills to successfully facilitate change in health care organizations. The course will explore elements of highly reliable organizations, culture of safety in the healthcare environment, the evolving science of quality improvement, and the use of clinical pathways to drive high-value health care."

It explores how advances in technology and data, and changes in policy and society, might affect the field of education, changing how we learn, and how children experience school.   Will these changes fundamentally alter the approach to schooling that has been pervasive in the United States for over a century, or will it only affect specific aspects of this system? What innovation is happening in the field today, and what big ideas are emerging that might lead to more dramatic disruption? What are the implications of this change for educators, students, and parents? For society at large? How are the benefits likely to be distributed, and what are the potential unintended consequences? What would success look like?   This course wrestles with these questions and more as it challenges students to anticipate the future of education management, policy, and reform, and figure out ways that Heinz students can contribute to ushering in this future in a way that is best for the human condition."

As defined, by David Baron, The nonmarket environment consists of the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions among companies and their public.    This class will focus on non-market strategies at the intersection of new technologies, public policies, and business.  Entrepreneurs and innovators interested in commercializing technology in the biomedical, energy, transportation, information technology, robotics, aerospace, food, healthcare, and other industries require more than knowing whether a technology works and the potential market.    Non-market factors such as regulations, standards, and grants influence product, price, location, research, development, and testing, and other decisions.  As a result, public policies provide both opportunities and challenges for the commercialization of an invention.  Only by recognizing these opportunities or overcoming these challenges can an invention become a commercialized innovation."	Deborah Stine	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A22							
90873	Public Policy in the Age of Innovation	6	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	"What aspects of your life would you prefer not be technologized? Your education? Friendships? Your choices? Can society reap the benefits of gene-editing, without any potential social costs? How would abundant, cost free renewable energy affect material consumption? The next generation of public policy leaders will grapple with innovation at an unprecedented scale, pace, and complexity. Where policymakers have historically used neo-classical philosophies to manage innovation towards sociated welfare, innovation is now blurring the physical, digital, and biological realms in a manner that redefines basic conceptions of welfare and creates new means to redistribute wealth and power.  This so called Fourth Industrial Revolution will create unimagined possibilities, both good and bad, that will necessitate a shift away from a linear management of innovation and its consequences to a highly complex, dynamic system that will redefine the role, efficacy, and practices of public institutions. In this course, we will study historical policy responses to previous industrial revolutions and assess how current innovation challenges conventional policy practices and their theoretical underpinnings.  Through interdisciplinary readings, case studies, class discussion, and a class project, students should expect to develop intuition for viewing innovation beyond its immediate, direct benefits to considering a broader array of outcomes defined by unintended consequences, inequity, and ethics. Armed with this knowledge, students should be able to both gauge the efficacy of traditional policy under the guise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution but advance new and creative ways to ensure that the balance of innovation serves all people and honors societal values."

From the earliest development of human expression to the technologically diverse present, visuals, performances, marketing, and play of all kinds, have utilized music to tell stories. Music in programming (movies/ TV shows/ games) is arguably the most influential method for exposing audiences to new artists and heightening the reach of superstars and/or classic artists. Today Music Supervision has transcended the simple goal of licensing songs for use in programming. The role can, and often does, serve as the key liaison between artists, labels, composers, directors, show runners, networks, finance, business and legal affairs, producers, marketing, consumer products, and press.  The goal of this class is to provide students with the broadest understanding of the job of Music Supervisor as well as the potential of music supervision as a career to parallel the hierarchy in production generally. From the PA role assisting the Music Supervisor working on a project at the production level, to the senior executive shaping a broad network/company music strategy, we will focus on the tools necessary to understand the realities and envision the possibilities."

Acting for Management will help you utilize the actors tools to become a more powerful and persuasive presenter, to feel more confident when communicating with others, to understand your audience and to show the world the best and most authentic version of you.  Through in-class exercises, prepared acting scenes and discussion, we will explore the use of physical tools (voice and body) as well as non-physical tools (imagination, emotion, focus, intention). These exercises and scenes will focus on situations you will encounter in professional organizations such as teamwork, conflict and power, among others. Because success in professional settings depends on your ability to clearly and dynamically communicate your ideas and skillfully navigate the politics of the organization, our focus for the class will be how to transfer the actors tools to real-world situations. Acting for Management is about you and your individual growth.  To make the most of it, you will need to attend all classes and participate fully in activities.

Arguably, the better a consultant you are, the better a communicator you are, and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other soft skills can derail a consulting engagement and with it, a promising consulting career. As an example, a Gartner Group study found that 80 of all IT projects were late, over budget, or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset.  This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value, incisive questions to building strong, long-term client relationships"	Stefan Labash	1<>3	1330	1450	HBH 1004							
94806	Privacy in the Digital Age	6	Heinz College Wide Courses	"Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?  This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on:  - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols,), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards,)   - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs,)"	Veronica Marotta	NA	NA	NA	NA

94866	Design Thinking	6	Heinz College Wide Courses	"Design thinking is a collaborative user centered process for the identification of problems and the definition of innovative solutions. Design thinking has been applied to the development of new products, the solution of social problems, the design of new business models and the improvement of existing processes. Design thinking is based in five premises which pervade the creative process: -"	User centered: Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these users is fundamental to a good solution. -	"Experimentation: Communicate your vision by creating experiences, using illustrations, prototypes and stories meaningful to your users -"	"Reframing the problem: Formulating the problem in different ways, one level above the current reality, one level down or from different points of view. -"	Collaboration: Problems and solutions are identified with the participation of all key stakeholders by s a cross-functional team that looks at many aspects of the solution.  Objectives: By the end of the course the student should be able to: Decide the suitability of applying design thinking in a given context Explain the design thinking process and its most common tools  Apply the design thinking process in the context of a service or software product definition	Eduardo Miranda	1<>3	1330	1450	HBH 1006			
94867	Decision Analytics for Business and Policy	12	Heinz College Wide Courses	"This course introduces modeling frameworks and computational tools to address complex, ill-defined, large-scale decision-making problems that arise in policy and business. Using a combination of lecturing, case studies and class discussions, it covers advanced methods of decision-making under uncertainty in four major areas: large-scale optimization, discrete event simulation, stochastic optimization and queuing theory. It will focus on modeling (how to formulate models to address policy- or business-relevant problems), computation (how to solve large-scale problems) and applications in policy and business (how to integrate viewpoints of different stakeholders, how to select the scope of the model, etc.). Applications are drawn from a variety of real-world settings in transportation, energy, information systems, health care, supply chain management, etc. Participants are expected to take active learning roles in the computational application of the materials presented in class using the R programming language and the CPLEX optimization solver. A term project simulates realistic and challenging issues where new solutions need to be developed, implemented and communicated. The prerequisite is an introductory course in Operations Research, such as Management Science I and II or Decision-Making under Uncertainty."	Alexandre Jacquillat	1<>3	1500	1620	HBH 1204

94870	Telling Stories with Data	6	Heinz College Wide Courses	"Data visualization is the art of understanding how humans understand our visual environment and of applying that knowledge to the visual representation of information.  Through the technique of data visualization we can express the stories that underlie the data, and identify specific elements that allow us to explain, persuade, and inform ourselves and others. This course will teach explanatory data visualization, where a visualization is used to communicate a specific understanding of data.  It will also focus on small data: datasets that fit within a spreadsheet or within a computers memory.  It will focus on visualization, not data manipulation.  It will also focus technique and theory rather than specific technologies.  The first half of the course will focus on understanding the techniques and theory of data visualization.  The second half of the course will be be focused on working through the process of a single data communication project, from initial analysis, through creation of a brief, identification of techniques, creating visualizations, and final presentation."

95710	Economic Analysis	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"This is a course in microeconomics and its implications for management and strategy - particularly (but not exclusively) in the context of information technology firms. Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision- making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.   The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms. We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents and economic outcomes in the context of game theory."	Karen Clay	1<>3	1330	1450	HBH 1202

95719	Accounting and Finance Foundations	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"Although basic math skills are required, this course is designed primarily for students without a quantitative background. The focus is on the basics of reading and interpreting financial statements in for-profit companies and financial evaluation of projects.  Owners (shareholders) expect managers to operate their companies in a way that produces profit. As such managers must know how their decisions affect the companys profits."

95744	Information Security Policy and Governance	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skill-attributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy - this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies."

95748	Software and Security	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"This course exposes students with limited exposure to programming and software engineering development foundational concepts to enable further understanding of the challenges of insecure and vulnerable software. Students are exposed to basic programming constructs (such as variables, control structures, data structures, programming syntax) as well as the specific principles of object-oriented programming languages. The course also surveys the types of threats and vulnerabilities inherent in software and the origins of these deficiencies. A brief overview of secure coding concepts and techniques are provided to students to provide exposure to how software can be made more secure and resilient and how security can be part of overall software development process."

95821	Product Management in IT	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"This introductory course (6 Units) is designed for MISM and MSIT students who are interested in exploring the roles and responsibilities associated with the planning, development and marketing of a product or service. By managing a product or service as a mini-business within an organization, product managers provide a critical leadership role and have the responsibility of making the product or service successful. They must manage the product in a complex, fluid environment affected by many influences such as customer needs, competitive offerings and threats, strategic planning and development cycles, budgetary constraints, product costs, and make vs. buy decisions  to name just a few.  While the scope of responsibilities seem critical (as well as interesting), product management is not always part of an organization, at least at first. Companies typically implement the product management function when a lack of coordination, communication and planning cause ineffective product developments, missed schedules, lost revenues, and disgruntled sales and development personnel (much less, dissatisfied customers). Engineers and technical support personnel who show some level of interest or knowledge about the customer, competition, and/or business are promoted to product manager roles, often with little or no product management training or understanding."

In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a model of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy.

95872	The Art & Science of Business Analytics	6	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	"Use of analytics is rapidly transforming managerial decision making and firms are starting to leverage analytics in the various functional areas of business to improve data-driven decision making. However, many firms are still unable to use data and analytics as a bridge between strategic themes and operations. While performance management systems are prevalent, their focus is primarily historical and they require the integration of a wide variety of data to track measures that may not be strategically relevant. Moreover, getting organizations to adopt emerging Big Data technologies to generate forward-looking analytics requires new technical and analytic skills that many organizations have not traditionally possessed. The aim of this mini-course is to understand what it takes for companies to successfully leverage data and analytics to become more customer-centric while driving improved business results while also providing opportunities for hands-on learning.  Introduce a framework for understanding what it takes for companies to successfully leverage data and analytics for competitive advantage. Understand how to develop strategies for building out strategic data and analytics capabilities. Provide an overview of the key analytics techniques from both a mathematical and data/technology perspective. Explore various analytic techniques and how they can be applied across the value chain of a companys business operations.

Whether a movie is in its preliminary or final stages of development, the setting of the film is essential to the overall storyline. Historical, fantastical or grounded in reality, each style and sense of place has its own impact on the storyline. We will look at the history of architecture in films, the role architecture plays in fantasy, futuristic, dystopian, and hybrid world building. We will also examine famous architecture, its destruction, and films that reach outside of what we understand as place and time. A captivating film is rooted in a strong storyline. A gripping storyline is nothing without the context in which its placed. The context, the built environment, and the architecture will be the focus of our exploration of film from the 20th century to the present day."

99238	"Materials, Energy and Environment"	9	Carnegie Mellon University-Wide Studies	"The survival of humans and the advancement of civilization and culture are a result of mankinds continued development of materials. From early times, civilizations with the most advanced materials have dominated the history of warfare and have been responsible for the infrastructural developments that have cradled out societies. As a result, materials have been influential in the trade and commerce between societies and are still to this day, strongly involved in the political, economic and social conflicts worldwide.    Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90 of the countrys energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological  implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact. Awareness of the complicated interaction is paramount for continued development of civilization. With the scale of industrialization that exists on our planet, consideration of  resource management, ethical material selection choices, energy management, and final disposal are all necessary to ensure a sustainable future."

In response, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and National Academy of Engineering (NAE) recently chose Pittsburgh as the pilot city for its Science and Engineering Ambassadors program, which selects, prepares, and supports local experts to providing the perspective of science and engineering as community members make energy choices in their personal and professional lives. This course links NAS/NAE Ambassadors and staff, CMU and Pitt students and faculty, and citizens for a series of events on energy topics. Students will review background literature on the energy landscape, read scholarship on energy issues of local concern, and collaborate with partners on public events to communicate energy issues. Through their work, students will increase their own understanding of and ability to engage publicly with energy issues, as well as contribute to the mission of the National Academies and the welfare of our local community. Discussions of technical issues enable students without advanced backgrounds in the engineering and the natural sciences to participate fully. Students from all disciplines, especially the social sciences and humanities, are welcome to join this interdisciplinary course.

Students must prepare a final work product such as a report that documents that independent learning was achieved.  For example, if the work is to determine the effectiveness of a university educational outreach program on the targeted population, the report should include information about the program, a review of literature related to the program goals, methods used to determine effectiveness (including any IRB approvals that are necessary), a summary of results, and recommendation of program improvement. Other projects may include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing a new outreach offering, or creating a more effective method for university students to learn about and participate in educational outreach programs. In-depth research about a topic related to education of children may be completed.  Recent projects topics include policies on gifted education in the US, religion and education, and mechanisms to help middle school students learn about careers and pathways to those careers."

This course introduces students from all academic majors, both undergraduate and graduate, to the socio-political significance and artistic merits of film.  Through screenings of acclaimed, international features and documentaries, through class discussions, and through workshops with award-winning filmmakers, students gain a basic foundation for film analysis. Through viewing the films and learning from the filmmakers firsthand accounts, the students will hone their critical thinking skills and learn to read the mainstream media with a more discerning eye.  Each student will translate the films themes, featured identity topic, directors perspectives, class discussions and their own cultural backgrounds and personal experiences into written reactions to the screenings and a final written analysis as part of the pass/fail component of the course."
