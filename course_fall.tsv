The most abundant biological entities are bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Their enormous diversity and number make bacteriophages important models for the study of gene structure, function and regulation, population genetics and evolution. In addition they are the source of important tools in biotechnology. The research goals of this course will be to identify new bacteriophage species and incorporate them into a comparative genomic study to better understand the genetic organization and evolution of these organisms. While accomplishing these goals students will develop an understanding of the research process, including the ability to design experiments and interpret novel data.    Fall semester: Samples will be collected in the field. From these samples students will identify and purify bacteriophages. The bacteriophages will be characterized structurally by electron microscopy, and their DNA will be purified and sequenced.	Jonathan Jarvik<>Natalie McGuier	2<>4	1330	1400	DH 2303

03-439	Introduction to Biophysics	9.0	Biological Sciences	This intermediate level course is primarily offered to Physics and Biology undergrads (junior/senior) and provides a modern view of molecular and cellular biology as seen from the perspective of physics, and quantified through the analytical tools of physics. This course will not review experimental biophysical techniques (which are covered, e.g., in 03-871). Rather, physicists will learn what sets bio apart from the remainder of the physics world and how the apparent dilemma that the existence of life represents to classical thermodynamics is reconciled. They also will learn the nomenclature used in molecular biology. In turn, biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models, non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different, apparently unrelated phenomena. One major goal is then to merge the two areas, physics and biology, in a unified perspective.	P. Loesche	2<>4	1500	1620	WEH 5304

05-434	Machine Learning in Practice	12.0	Human-Computer Interaction	Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

06-779	Physics and Engineering of Complex Fluids	12.0	Chemical Engineering	Complex fluids include solutions of polymers or surfactants, emulsions, foams and liquid suspensions of colloidal nanoparticles or microparticles.  What makes a fluid a complex fluid is an exquisite sensitivity of its macroscopic properties (viscoelasticity, for example) to strong, often long-range interactions among dispersed constituents.  A suspension of lipid vesicles represents a complex fluid on two levels: the suspension is a complex fluid, and the lipid bilayers that comprise vesicles are complex fluids.  Complex fluids are ubiquitous in industry and nature, and similar scientific concepts are invoked when seeking to understand cell membranes and when formulating a pharmaceutical suspension or printing ink. Students in this course will learn how similar scientific concepts appear in what would otherwise seem to be quite distinct natural systems and engineered systems.

08-604	Foundations of Privacy	12.0	Institute for Software Research	Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, Web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed - statistical disclosure limitation (as may be used by the census bureau in releasing statistics), semantics and logical specification of privacy policies that constrain information flow and use (e.g., by privacy regulations such as the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), principled audit and accountability mechanisms for enforcing privacy policies, anonymous communication protocols - and other settings in which privacy concerns have prompted much research, such as in social networks, location privacy and Web privacy (in particular, online tracking  targeted advertising).

08-632	Law of Computer Technology	6.0	Institute for Software Research	This course consists of the first half of the 12-unit course 08-732.  It is both a survey of computer law and an examination of how courts evaluate technological evidence in their decision-making. It deals with the most important and controversial issues in technology law today. The material is divided into six primary subjects: 1. Legal process: how courts operate, how lawsuits are conducted, what happens in appeals, who has to obey the determination of a court, over whom can a court exercise power, and regulatory law. 2. Evidence: what has to be proven to a court and how it is done, rules of evidence, burdens of proof, expert testimony. 3. Business Transactions: software licenses, clickwrap contracts, electronic transactions. 4. Personal Intrusions: social media, libel and defamation, data privacy, position monitoring. 5. Intellectual Property: trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. No legal background is required or assumed. This is not a law school course. Great effort is expended to keep the syllabus current based on breaking legal events. Therefore, the content and ordering of lectures may vary somewhat as the course progresses.

08-725	Social Software Engineering	6.0	Institute for Software Research	Today, socialness appears to be of great significance and under constant scrutiny in the domain of software, where it is both fostered and leveraged. As it relates to various aspects of software and how software is build - from people, products and processes, to technologies, tools and trade and even more - understanding social and human aspects of software engineering is essential.  This course will pull together relevant literature from multiple domains to better understand the various social and human aspects of software engineering. To that end, we will explore both: the social aspects of software engineering and the engineering aspects of social software.

09-122	Molecular Tools for Biological and Chemical Studies	6.0	Chemistry	The increased fluorescence of certain molecules, also known as dyes, can signal their binding to a specific biological target such as DNA. This phenomenon finds important application in the biological and medicinal field where dyes are used as molecular tools. For example, fluorescent dyes can be used to detect the expression of a gene; survival of cells; site of accumulation of a metabolite and many of them are used in diagnostics. This course is aimed at offering a hands-on laboratory experience in the interface of chemistry and biology, so called bioorganic chemistry. The students project will be to prepare a dye, thiazole orange, that will show increased fluorescence upon binding DNA or a protein, thus, signaling the binding event. A dye designed to prevent DNA binding will be tested alongside to highlight how molecular design works. Molecular size and geometry are important elements in the design of molecules that specifically bind biological targets; 3D molecular modeling software (freeware) and hand-held models will be used to analyze how these factors play a role in target-dye interaction.

10-605	TBA	12.0	Machine Learning	Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.  The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student. The project will be designed to compare the scalability of variant learning algorithms on datasets.  An introductory course in machine learning, like 10-601 or 10-701, is a prerequisite or a co-requisite. If you plan to take this course and 10-601 concurrently please tell the instructor.  The course will include several substantial programming assignments, so an additional prerequisite is 15-211, or 15-214, or comparable familiarity with Java and good programming skills.  Undergraduates need permission of the instructor to enroll.	William Cohen	2<>4	1330	1450	WEH 7500

10-701	Introduction to Machine Learning (PhD)	12.0	Machine Learning	Machine learning studies the question How can we build computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience?   This includes learning to perform many types of tasks based on many types of experience.  For example, it includes robots learning to better navigate based on experience gained by roaming their environments, medical decision aids that learn to predict which therapies work best for which diseases based on data mining of historical health records, and speech recognition systems that learn to better understand your speech based on experience listening to you.  This course is designed to give PhD students a thorough grounding in the methods, mathematics and algorithms needed to do research and applications in machine learning. Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that anyone with a strong numerate background can catch up and fully participate. You can evaluate your ability to take the course via a self-assessment exam that will be made available to you  after you register.  If you are interested in this topic, but are not a PhD student, or are a PhD student not specializing in machine learning, you might consider the masters level course on Machine Learning, 10-601.  This class may be appropriate for MS and undergrad students who are interested in the theory and algorithms behind ML.

10-704	Information Processing and Learning	12.0	Machine Learning	Whats the connection between how many bits we can send over a channel and how accurately we can classify documents or fit a curve to data? Is there any link between decision trees, prefix codes and wavelet transforms? What about max-entropy and maximum likelihood, or universal coding and online learning? This inter-disciplinary course will explore these and other questions that link the fields of information theory, signal processing, and machine learning, all of which aim to understand the information contained in data. The goal is to highlight the common concepts and establish concrete links between these fields that enable efficient information processing and learning.  The course will do a short but introductory review of basic information theory, including entropy and fundamental limits of data compression, data processing and Fanos inequalities, channel capacity, and rate-distortion theory. Then we will dig into the connections to learning including: estimation of information theoretic quantities (such entropy, mutual information, and divergence) and their applications in learning, information theoretic lower bounds for machine learning problems, duality of max entropy and maximum likelihood, connections between clustering and rate-distortion theory, universal coding and online learning, and more.  Pre-requisites: Fundamentals of Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra and Real analysis.	Aarti Singh	1<>3	1500	1620	GHC 4102
10-715	Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning	12.0	Machine Learning	The rapid improvement of sensory techniques and processor speed, and the availability of inexpensive massive digital storage, have led to a growing demand for systems that can automatically comprehend and mine massive and complex data from diverse sources.  Machine Learning is becoming the primary mechanism by which information is extracted from Big Data, and a primary pillar that Artificial Intelligence is built upon.  This course is designed for Ph.D. students whose primary field of study is machine learning, or who intend to make machine learning methodological research a main focus of their thesis.  It will give students a thorough grounding in the algorithms, mathematics, theories, and insights needed to do in-depth research and applications in machine learning. The topics of this course will in part parallel those covered in the general graduate machine learning course (10-701), but with a greater emphasis on depth in theory and algorithms.   The course will also include additional advanced topics such as privacy in machine learning, interactive learning, reinforcement learning, online learning,  Bayesian nonparametrics, and additional material on graphical models.  Students entering the class are expected to have a pre-existing strong working knowledge of algorithms, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.  If you are interested in this topic, but do not have the required background or are not planning to work on a PhD thesis with machine learning as the main focus, you might consider the general graduate Machine Learning course (10-701) or the Masters-level Machine Learning course (10-601).

10-725	TBA	None	Machine Learning	Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints.  This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics.  Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken 10-701 or an equivalent machine learning or statistics class is strongly encouraged, since we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class.  Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester; those wanting to take the class without the project can register under the 9 unit option.

10-805	Machine Learning with Large Datasets	12.0	Machine Learning	Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.  An introductory course in machine learning, like 10-601 or 10-701, is a prerequisite or a co-requisite.     The class will include programming assignments, presentation of relevant research papers to the class, and a research project chosen by the student, to be presented to the class, and written up in a conference-paper format.     10-805 will share lectures with 10-605, but 10-805 students need to make class presentations and complete a research project, and will do fewer programming assignments, so 10-805 students are expected to be capable of surveying recent literature and conducting research. Four lecture sessions for 10-605 will also be reserved for 10-805 students presentations.    If there is sufficient interest we will introduce a mechanism for 10-605 students to collaborate of 10-805 students on projects.	William Cohen	2<>4	1330	1450	WEH 7500
10-807	Topics in Deep Learning	12.0	Machine Learning	Building intelligent machines that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks. In the past few years, researchers across many different communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep (hierarchical) models -- models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.  This is an advanced graduate course, designed for Masters and Ph.D. level students, and will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the recent and exciting developments of various deep learning methods. Some topics to be covered include: restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their multi-layer extensions Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann machines; sparse coding, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and attention-based models with applications in vision, NLP, and multimodal learning. We will also address mathematical issues, focusing on efficient large-scale optimization methods for inference and learning, as well as training density models with intractable partition functions.

11-344	Machine Learning in Practice	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand.  It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries.  This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.

11-411	Natural Language Processing	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	This course will introduce students to the highly interdisciplinary area of Artificial Intelligence known alternately as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics. The course aims to cover the techniques used today in software that does useful things with text in human languages like English and Chinese. Applications of NLP include automatic translation between languages, extraction and summarization of information in documents, question answering and dialog systems, and conversational agents. This course will focus on core representations and algorithms, with some time spent on real-world applications. Because modern NLP relies so heavily on Machine Learning, well cover the basics of discrete classification and probabilistic modeling as we go. Good computational linguists also know about Linguistics, so topics in linguistics (phonology, morphology, and syntax) will be covered when fitting. From a software engineering perspective, there will be an emphasis on rapid prototyping, a useful skill in many other areas of Computer Science. In particular, we will introduce some high-level languages (e.g., regular expressions and Dyna) and some scripting languages (e.g., Python and Perl) that can greatly simplify prototype implementation.

11-661	Language & Statistics	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.

The course is self-paced and there will be no scheduled lecture times, however, students are welcome to set up meetings with the instructor as desired, and students who prefer to have a weekly or bi-monthly regularly scheduled meeting with the instructor are welcome to arrange for that. If there is sufficient interest, an informal reading group may be formed to supplement the lab work.    Students will design their own project, which they will discuss with the instructor for approval. Students are encouraged to select a topic from semantics, pragmatics, or discourse analysis, such as entailment, evidentiality, implicature, information status, or rhetorical structure, and a topic from language technologies, such as sentiment analysis or summarization, and explore how the linguistic topic applies to some aspect of the chosen language technology. Students are encouraged to contrast symbolic, formal, and knowledge based approaches with empirical approaches.    Each student will work independently. If multiple students work as a team on a particular topic, each should choose an approach that is different from the approaches used by the other students working on the same problem. Students will be responsible to set up a web page, blog, or wiki to post progress reports and other supporting documents, data, and analyses. The web space will be checked by the instructor periodically , and thus should be kept updated in order to reflect on-going progress. The web space will also serve as a shared project space in the case that students are working in a team for the project.	Carolyn Rose	NA	NA	NA	NA

11-736	Graduate Seminar on Endangered Languages	6.0	Language Technologies Institute	The purpose of this seminar is to allow students to better understand the linguistic, social and political issues when working with language technologies for endangered languages. Often in LTI we concentrate on issues of modeling with small amounts of data, or designing optimal strategies for collecting data, but ignore many of wider practical issues that appear when working with endangered languages.     This seminar will consist of reading books and papers, and having participants give presentations; a few invited talks (e.g. from field linguists, and language advocates) will also be included. It will count for 6 units of LTI course credit. It may be possible for interested students to also carry out a related 6-unit project as a lab.

11-745	Advanced Statistical Learning Seminar	6.0	Language Technologies Institute	This seminar aims to deepen the participants understanding of the theoretical foundation of statistical learning and applications, to broaden their knowledge of new techniques, directions and challenges in the field, and to inspire research ideas through class-room discussions.  In the past years, this seminar was structured as a 12-unit course in the form of group-reading, presenting and discussing the book (chapter by chapter) of The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction by Trevor Hastie et al. In the fall of 2014, we will have a 6-unit seminar, focusing on New Methods in Large-scale Structured Learning, with selected papers from the past 2-3 years of ICML, NIPS, KDD, JMLR or the like, plus related background reading. We will meet once a week, one topic per week (1-2 papers), with presentations rotating among participants. In each week, the assigned presenter starts with the questions from all the participants (collected by email) about the current topic, followed by a presentation on that topic and leads the discussion. All the students are required to read the assigned paper(s) of the week before the class, and email their questions to the presenter (CC to everybody). By the end of the semester, each student will individually write a short 3-4-page white paper outlining a research proposal for new work extending one of the research areas discussed in class.  There will be no exams or homework; the grading is based on class participation, quality of the seminar presentation(s), questions submitted for each class and discussions, and the final brief paper. Prerequisites: Intro machine learning and related courses	Yiming Yang	2	0900	1020	WEH 5316
11-751	Speech Recognition and Understanding	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	The technology to allow humans to communicate by speech with machines or by which machines can understand when humans communicate with each other is rapidly maturing. This course provides an introduction to the theoretical tools as well as the experimental practice that has made the field what it is today. We will cover theoretical foundations, essential algorithms, major approaches, experimental strategies and current state-of-the-art systems and will introduce the participants to ongoing work in representation, algorithms and interface design. This course is suitable for graduate students with some background in computer science and electrical engineering, as well as for advanced undergraduates. Prerequisites: Sound mathematical background, knowledge of basic statistics, good computing skills. No prior experience with speech recognition is necessary. This course is primarily for graduate students in LTI, CS, Robotics, ECE, Psychology, or Computational Linguistics. Others by prior permission of instructor.	Florian Metze	1<>3	1630	1750	WEH 4623
11-755	Machine Learning for Signal Processing	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.	Bhiksha Ramakrishnan	2<>4	1500	1620	BH A53
11-761	Language & Statistics	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.

11-776	Human Communication and Multimodal Computation	12.0	Language Technologies Institute	Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance, in that participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on verbal and nonverbal displays and signals. Human interpersonal behaviors have long been studied in linguistic, communication, sociology and psychology. The recent advances in machine learning, pattern recognition and signal processing enabled a new generation of computational tools to analyze, recognize and predict human communication behaviors during social interactions. This new research direction have broad applicability, including the improvement of human behavior recognition, the synthesis of natural animations for robots and virtual humans, the development of intelligent tutoring systems, and the diagnoses of social disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder).   This is a graduate course primarily for students in LTI, HCII and Robotics; others, for example (undergraduate) students of CS or professional masters, by prior permission of the instructor. Students should have proper academic background in probability, statistic and linear algebra. Previous experience in machine learning is suggested but not obligatory. Programming knowledge in Matlab and/or Python is recommended.	Louis-Philippe Morency	2<>4	1630	1750	GHC 4211
11-782	Self-Paced Lab for Computational Biology	None	Language Technologies Institute	Students will choose from a set of projects designed by the instructor. Students will also have the option of designing their own projects, subject to instructor approval. For the students who had completed a project in the 10-810 course, they can either switch to another project, or continue working on the previous project by aiming a significant progress (subject to instructor approval). Each student will work independently. If more than one student work on a particular topic, each should choose an approach that is different from the approaches used by the other students working on the same problem. The students need to begin with a project proposal to outline the high-level ideas, tasks, and goals of the problem, and plan of experiments and/or analysis. The instructor will consult with you on your ideas , but the final responsibility to define and execute an interesting piece of work is yours. Your project will have two final deliverables: 1. a writeup in the form of a NIPS paper (8 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references), worth 60 of the project grade, and 2. a research seminar presentation of your work at the end of the semester, worth 20 of the project grade. In addition, you must turn in a midway progress report (5 pages maximum in NIPS format, including references) describing the results of your first experiments, worth 20 of the project grade. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits are strict Papers over the limit will not be considered. The grading of your project are based on overall scientific quality, novelty, writing, and clarity of presentation. We expect your final report to be of conference-paper quality, and you are expected to also deliver software implementation of your algorithmic results.	Eric Xing	NA	NA	NA	NA

The classroom component guides students in project planning, team management, development of requirements and design specifications, and software tools for managing group-oriented projects.  The lab component provides project-specific technical guidance and expertise, for example in the development of a question answering system, dialog, or sentiment analysis application.  Thus, each project receives two types of supervision, often from two separate members of the faculty.	Ralf Brown	NA	NA	NA	NA

15-150	Principles of Functional Programming	10.0	Computer Science	An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.

15-291	Special Topic: Applied Computational Intelligence Lab	9.0	Computer Science	What would an intelligent picture on the wall do? What if it could see and hear you? What should it say if it could talk? What if your pantry, wardrobe or medicine cabinet could sense, think and act? What should they do and say? What should your cell phone be saying to you? These are not whimsical or theoretical questions...they inevitably arise as ordinary everyday objects around us acquire the ability to sense changes in their environment, think about their implications, and act in pursuit of their goals. These objects are connected to the web and become conduits for services, erasing the distinction between products and services. The ability to invent and build smart products/services is becoming a key skill in the new technology-driven services economy.    The focus of the course will be on building ordinary objects that can sense, think and act in the real world and on exploring the implications of these capabilities. Students will select their own project and by the end of the semester will create a working prototype that will be exhibited in a public place. Prizes will be offered for the most creative projects. In the course of their projects, students will learn how to use state-of-the-art tools for:    Object detection using video cameras, microphones and other sensors  Movement and gesture detection  Speech recognition and generation    Reasoning and planning:  While the course organizers have many ideas for specific projects, students will be encouraged to design their own projects.

15-390	Entrepreneurship for Computer Science	9.0	Computer Science	This course is designed to develop skills related to entrepreneurship and innovation for non-business undergraduate and graduate students in the School of Computer Science.  The course assumes no background courses in business and is appropriate for those who are interested in bringing innovations to market either through new companies or existing companies.   The course provides an overview of entrepreneurship and innovation, develops an entrepreneurial frame of mind, and provides a framework for learning the rudiments of how to generate ideas.  Students come up with or are presented with potential ideas and learn how to develop these ideas into opportunities, and to explore their potential for becoming viable businesses.  They learn how to do market research, to develop go-to-market strategies, value propositions and to differentiate their products or services from potential competitors.  The focus is on understanding and developing strategies for approaching the key elements of the entrepreneurial process...opportunity, resources and team. The course consists of a balance of lectures, case studies and encounters with entrepreneurs, investors and business professionals.  The students are exposed to financial and intellectual property issues, and encounter a real world perspective on entrepreneurship, innovation and leadership.  The output of the course is a mini-business plan or venture opportunity screening document that can be developed into a business plan in a subsequent course entitled New Venture Creation or through independent study.

15-410	Operating System Design and Implementation	15.0	Computer Science	Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and team programming skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2s-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.  Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester begins to discuss your educational goals.	David Eckhardt<>David O'Hallaron	1<>3<>5	1030	1120	SH 125

15-440	Distributed Systems	12.0	Computer Science	The goals of this course are twofold: First, for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across the network. Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.	Srinivasan Seshan<>Yuvraj Agarwal	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 100

15-455	Undergraduate Complexity Theory	9.0	Computer Science	Complexity theory is the study of how much of a resource (such as time, space, parallelism, or randomness) is required to perform some of the computations that interest us the most. In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.

15-463	Computational Photography	12.0	Computer Science	Computational Photography is an emerging new field created by the  convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and  photography. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the  traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a  richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful  representation of our visual world.    The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in  which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to  generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to  acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs.  Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an  emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This  hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in  which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images  of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and  synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.

15-513	Introduction to Computer Systems	12.0	Computer Science	This course provides a programmers view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation.  You can sign up for 15-513 for either 6 or 12 credits.  The reason there are two options is that you might be taking 15-513 in order to review the material and qualify to take other courses in your program. If this is the case, we expect that the work load for 15-513 will be more like a 6 unit class.  If, on the other hand, you are seeing the material for the first time, then it will be like a 12-unit course for you.  So, you need to decide, possibly in conjunction with your advisor which situation you are in and then sign up for the proper number of units.	Brian Railing	NA	NA	NA	NA

15-619	Cloud Computing	12.0	Computer Science	GATES HILLMAN 4307  This course gives students an overview of Cloud Computing, which is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures.  Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models.  Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.

They often dominate the performance of a system, and their components inner workings require amazing feats of engineering. At the same time, storage systems hold the crown jewels of most organizations: their information (from source code to Microsofts software to the sales databases of every e-commerce site). Within the field of computer systems and computer engineering, there is no area whose demand for bright people and better solutions is more robust.   This course will cover the design, implementation, and use of storage systems, from the characteristics and operation of individual storage devices to the OS, database, and networking approaches involved in tying them together and making them useful. Along the way, we will examine several case studies of real systems, demands placed on storage systems by important applications, and impacts of trends and emerging technologies on future storage systems.   For those familiar with 18-316 (Intro. to Data Storage Systems Technology) and 18-517 (Data Storage Systems Design Project): one should consider these courses as distinct and complementary, with neither being a pre-requisite to the other. 18-316 and 18-517 focus on the low-level technologies (magnetics, materials, applied physics, etc.) whereas 746 focuses on storages incorporation and role in computer systems.

15-781	Artificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem Solving	12.0	Computer Science	This course is about the theory and practice of Artificial Intelligence. We will study modern techniques for computers to represent task-relevant information and make intelligent (i.e. satisficing or optimal) decisions towards the achievement of goals. The search and problem solving methods are applicable throughout a large range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic, and information systems. We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data. We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn. We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents. Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including natural language processing, web-based search engines, industrial applications, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making.

15-819	Research Seminar in Programming Languages: Domain-Specific Languages	12.0	Computer Science	These days, making your own programming language is all the rage. If Facebook and Apple have them, then we should all have them too. But what does it mean to make a programming language? What does it mean to make a research language? What is a programming language? This seminar aims to answer these questions by providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in domain-specific languages. We begin with a survey of domain-specific languages, from those well-specified in research to those popular in practice, as well as tools and techniques for specifying and implementing domain-specific languages. We then go into more depth for languages for systems programming, security, and biological modelling.

15-821	Mobile and Pervasive Computing	12.0	Computer Science	This is a course exploring research issues in the emerging fields of mobile computing and its close relative, pervasive computing. Many traditional areas of computer science and computer engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobile and pervasive computing. Examples include network protocols, power management, user interfaces, file access, usability and security. This will be an advanced course in the truest sense --- most, if not all, the topics discussed will be ones where there is little consensus in the research community on the best approaches. The course will also offer significant hand-on experience in this area.   Each student will have to present and lead the discussion on a number of papers. Students will work in groups of three under the guidance of a mentor on a hands-on project. Each student will also be required to write one of two documents based on an idea in mobile and pervasive computing: (a) a research proposal (similar in spirit to an NSF proposal) or (b) a short business plan for a commercial opportunity. Grading will be based on the quality of the presentations, the project, the proposal or business plan, and brief in-class quizzes on the readings.

15-862	Computational Photography	12.0	Computer Science	COURSE OVERVIEW: Computational Photography is an emerging new field created by the convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and photography. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful representation of our visual world.  The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs. Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.

16-223	Introduction to Physical Computing	10.0	Robotics	Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems that use a mix of software and hardware to sense and respond to the surrounding world.  Such systems blend digital and physical processes into toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, and more.  This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities.  The course is organized around a series of practical hands-on exercises which introduce the fundamentals of circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms, actuation, and time-based behavior.  The key objective is gaining an intuitive understanding of how information and energy move between the physical, electronic, and computational domains to create a desired behavior.  The exercises provide building blocks for collaborative projects which utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider how to make things, but also for whom we design, and why the making is worthwhile.  This course is an IDeATe Portal Course for entry into either of the IDeATe Intelligent Environments or Physical Computing programs.  CFA/DC/TPR students can enroll under 16-223; CIT/MCS/SCS students can enroll in the 60-223 version of the course.  Please note that there will be lab usage and materials fees associated with this course.	Garth Zeglin	1<>3	0930	1120	HL A10
16-362	Mobile Robot Programming Laboratory	12.0	Robotics	This course is a comprehensive hands-on introduction to the concepts and basic algorithms needed to make a mobile robot function reliably and effectively. We will work in small groups with small robots that are controlled over wireless from your laptop computers. The robots are Neato household vacuum robots that have been converted to mini forktrucks that can move pallets from place to place just like commercial automated guided vehicles do today. The robots are programmed in the modern MATLAB programming environment. It is a pretty easy language to learn, and a very powerful one for prototyping robotics algorithms.   You will get a lot of experience in this course in addition to some theory. Lectures are focused on the content of the next lab. There is a lab every week and they build on each other so that a complete robot software system results. The course will culminate with a class-wide robot competition that tests the performance of all of your code implemented in the semester. In order to succeed in the course, students must have a 2nd year science/engineering level background in mathematics (matrices, vectors, coordinate systems) and have already mastered at least one procedural programming language like C or Java. When the course is over, you will have written a single software system that has been incrementally extended in functionality and regularly debugged throughout the semester.

16-450	Robotics Systems Engineering	12.0	Robotics	Systems engineering examines methods of specifying, designing, analyzing and testing complex systems.  In this course, principles and processes of systems engineering are introduced and applied to the development of robotic devices.  The focus is on robotic system engineered to perform complex behavior. Such systems embed computing elements, integrate sensors and actuators, operate in a reliable and robust fashion, and demand rigorous engineering from conception through production. The course is organized as a progression through the systems engineering process of conceptualization, specification, design, and prototyping with consideration of verification and validation.  Students completing this course will engineer a robotic system through its compete design and initial prototype.  The project concept and teams can continue into the Spring-semester (16-474 Robotics Capstone) for system refinement, testing and demonstration.	David Wettergreen	2<>4	1500	1620	WEH 5316

Please contact the MS-RT director.   Extended Project Course Sequence (EPCS): The EPCS is a thread that runs through the MS-RTs two semesters during Year-One at a partner institution, two semesters during Year-Two on the CMU-Pittsburgh campus, and the summer between the two academic years. It is a research experience intended to prepare international professional masters degree students in robotics for future entrepreneurial careers in their home countries. Its aim is less to require that they personally augment humanitys knowledge base, as would be required in an academic/research degree program, and more to teach them how to evaluate others research for its entrepreneurial potential, and to learn the process for transitioning it from a university lab to a position of economic value and social benefit. The five course modules of the sequence are identified as prepare, plan, execute, analyze, and present. Prepare  means to develop a high-level understanding of the research-with-a-goal architecting process. Plan means to identify, propose, and schedule the intended course of a specific project. Execute means to obtain data, preferably with an industrial sponsor identified in the plan  segment, but potentially alternatively in a university research lab.  Analyze means to draw defensible conclusions from the data, and accordingly to plan a commercialization route. Present is the professional programs alternative to a research thesis: students present their conclusions and future plans in several different formats each targeting a different clearly identified dissemination medium and audience interest, for example, written and orally presented versions of a professional magazine article, a trade show poster presentation, an engineering teams technical report, and a pitch to a venture capital source.

16-623	Advanced Computer Vision Apps.	12.0	Robotics	Computer vision is a discipline that attempts to extract information from images and videos. Nearly every smart device on the planet has a camera, and people are increasingly interested in how to develop apps that use computer vision to perform an ever expanding list of things including: 3D mapping, photo/image search, people/object tracking, augmented reality etc. This course is intended for graduate students who are familiar with computer vision, and are keen to learn more about the applying state of the art vision methods on smart devices and embedded systems. A strong programming background is a must (at a minimum good knowledge of C/C++), topics will include using conventional computer vision software tools (OpenCV, MATLAB toolboxes, VLFeat, CAFFE, Torch 7), and development on iOS devices using mobile vision libraries such as GPUImage, Metal and fast math libraries like Armadillo and Eigen. For consistency, all app development will be in iOS and it is expected that all students participating in the class have access to an Intel-based MAC running OS X Mavericks or later. Although the coursework will be focused on a single operating system, the knowledge gained from this class will easily generalize to other mobile platforms such as Android etc.	Simon Lucey	2<>4	1200	0120	NSH 3002

16-650	Systems Engineering and Management for Robotics	12.0	Robotics	Practically everything around us is a system-from the cell phone in your pocket to the International Space System up in the sky. The higher the complexity of the system, the more its creators benefit from applying formal processes to its development-processes that are collectively known under the umbrella systems engineering. Systems Engineering is a formal discipline that guides a product from conception and design all the way to production, marketing, servicing, and disposal. In this course we will study the fundamental elements of systems engineering as they apply to the development of robotic systems. We will cover topics such as needs analysis, requirements elicitation and formalization, system architecture development, trade studies, verification and validation, etc. In addition, for this course we will cover core topics of Project Management that must be performed in tandem with Systems Engineering to achieve a successful project and product. For the Project Management we will cover work breakdown structures, scheduling, estimation, and risk management. We will study both classical and agile methods in project management. The students will apply most of the elements of this course  in the MRSD Project Course I and II, thus giving them the opportunity to put the theory in practice in a real product design activity. Please note that this course is for MRSD students only. (Past project examples: http://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/project-examples/)	Dimitrios Apostolopoulos	2<>4	1200	0120	NSH 1305
16-681	MRSD Project 1	12.0	Robotics	(Required Project Course for the MRSD students.) Students will be required to participate in a two-semester on-campus lecture- and laboratory-style project course. The project course requires students to form small project teams to work on a hands-on robotics / automation topic proposed by the instructor(s) and of interest to the robotics / automation industry at large. The project is intended to allow students to acquire hands-on experience and apply concepts and methods taught in class. Class lectures will emphasize practical application and cover relevant topics including robotic design methodologies, system modeling, mechanical components, sensor and I/O interfacing, motor control, microcontroller and embedded control basics, basic software development methodologies, and troubleshooting. The setting will consist of a mix of targeted technology instruction / lectures and hands-on work in the laboratory. Students will learn the interconnection of theory and practice and understand the challenges of real-world application. The course will provide opportunities to apply principles from other MRSD courses, especially the Systems Engineering course, as well as those from the Intro to Robotics Business course. Students will be taught the project / technology development process from developing performance-requirements/system-specifications through test-plan development, the technology development cycle, and results analysis and reporting. The outcome of this two-semester course will be a working robot, a public demonstration, and a final project report.	John Dolan	2<>4	1500	1650	NSH 1305
16-697	Introduction to Robotics Business	9.0	Robotics	(For MRSD students only.) This course will help students develop business plans in the context of a new world filled with robots and robotic systems.  One of many examples is the new technology of driverless cars; every major automotive company has them in their product pipeline. What opportunities does this represent to a new robotics entrepreneur?  We help to identify an opportunity for a robotics business and explore the business fundamentals of how to build and manage it.  The first step is to develop an appropriate innovative idea that can find a profitable home in the marketplace.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the prevalent trends of the current economic environment and how to market and position your product.  Here we utilize experts in marketing and innovation management.  The product may be a consumer product, or an improvement process  for some aspect of a business cycle (e.g., manufacturing or service).  However, we expect that the selected invention will be a new type of robot, a robotic application or part of an ever expanding robotic-ecosystem.  Please note that we have a very expansive view of what can count as a robot  Once a project area is selected we introduce the financial basics that are necessary to fund and sustain a new product initiative.  In the end, the product idea must be sold to either venture capitalists, private funding agents, corporate funding agents or government agencies.  The course is a project based and is executed by a team of you and your fellow students.  The final report can either be a business plan or a proposal for funding from an agency such as NSF (Small Business Innovation Research).  Professor Bourne has taught robotics to CMU business students since 1988.  Now for the first time he is teaching business to robotics students along with a handful of top CMU Tepper School Business Faculty.	David Bourne	5	1000	1320	NSH 1305

16-722	Sensing and Sensors	12.0	Robotics	The principles and practices of quantitative perception (sensing) illustrated by the devices and algorithms (sensors) that implement them.  Learn to critically examine the sensing requirements of robotics applications, to specify the required sensor characteristics, to analyze whether these specifications can be realized even in principle, to compare what can be realized in principle to what can actually be purchased or built, to understand the engineering factors that account for the discrepancies, and to design transducing, digitizing, and computing systems that come tolerably close to realizing the actual capabilities of available sensors.   Grading will be based on homework assignments, class participation, and a final exam.  Three or four of the homework assignments will be hands-on take-home labs done with an Arduino kit that students will purchase in lieu of purchasing a textbook.  Top-level course modules will cover (1) sensors, signals, and measurement science, (2) origins, nature, and amelioration of noise, (3) end-to-end sensing systems, (4) cameras and other imaging sensors and systems, (5) range sensing and imaging, (6) navigation sensors and systems, (7) other topics of interest to the class (as time allows).

16-831	Statistical Techniques in Robotics	12.0	Robotics	Probabilistic and learning techniques are now an essential part of building robots (or embedded systems) designed to operate in the real world. These systems must deal with uncertainty and adapt to changes in the environment by learning from experience. Uncertainty arises from many sources: the inherent limitations in our ability to model the world, noise and perceptual limitations in sensor measurements, and the approximate nature of algorithmic solutions. Building intelligent machines also requires that they adapt to their environment. Few things are more frustrating than machines that repeat the same mistake over and over again. Well explore (1) modern learning techniques that are effective at learning online: i.e. throughout the robots operation, and (2) efficient probabilistic inference algorithms in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping	Kris Kitani<>Michael Kaess	2<>4	1330	1450	GHC 4215
16-843	Manipulation Algorithms	12.0	Robotics	This is an advanced graduate-level class on the theory and algorithms that enable robots to physically manipulate their world, on their own or in collaboration with people. The class will first focus on functional aspects of manipulation, such as synthesizing robust and stable grasps for dexterous hands and motion planning in these spaces, as well as learning for manipulation, such as how to predict stable grasps from demonstration and experience. Moving forward, we will discuss additional requirements that arise from performing manipulation tasks collaboratively with people: moving from purely functional aspects of motion to incorporating the human into the loop, and coordinating human and robot actions via understanding and expressing intent.

17-413	Software Engineering Reflection	6.0	Software Engineering	This course is an opportunity to reflect on a software engineering experience you have had in industry.  It is structured as a writers workshop, in which you will work with the instructor and other students to identify and flesh out a software engineering theme that is illustrated by your industry experience.  You will prepare a 10-page report on this theme, comparable to a practitioners report at a conference like ICSE or OOPSLA, and a 30-minute presentation to match.  This course fulfills a requirement of the Software Engineering Minor program, but students in other programs may take the course if they meet the prerequisite industry experience and if space is available.	William Scherlis	3	1530	1620	WEH 4220
17-602	Introduction to Personal Software Process	6.0	Software Engineering	The purpose of this course is to introduce the highest-leverage metrics of the Personal Software Process (PSP), specifically the ones associated with improving time estimation and reducing defects.  The central subject of this course is process, not product. The programs that you will do are a means of teaching process, not an end product in themselves. The amount of process activity is clearly excessive for these simple problems. We suggest you read through all the programming problem specifications at the beginning so you will know where they are going early in the course. Then, when you feel that the process burden is too great, imagine doing a series of 300 line modules using the PSP, and see if you feel differently. We think that you will see the point very quickly and find yourself unconsciously applying parts of PSP to your own work before the course is done.  This course is intended for practicing software engineers and their managers. The measures introduced can serve as the basis for software development process improvement in the organization as well as helping individuals. Students who go on to take a more comprehensive course in the PSP will be able to concentrate more completely on advanced metrics and PSP is required if you intend to follow on with the concepts in the Team Software Process (TSP).  Requirement:  Since this is a development oriented class and involves writing code, all the normal tools one may use to develop code in their language of choice are required. You should NOT use this course as an opportunity to learn a new language as this course is intended to measure your already instantiated personal process.  Learning a new language will most likely cause you to change your personal process. Course requirements are not solely grounded in theory.

17-611	DevOps: Engineering for Deployment and Operations	12.0	Software Engineering	DevOps is the term given to a modern movement to establish practices that significantly reduce the time to production of committed code. This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production  and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays.  Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems.	Len Bass<>Hasan Yasar	1<>3	1330	1450	3SC 265
17-630	Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers	12.0	Software Engineering	I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.                -  Linus Torvalds The aim of this course is to provide students with a solid foundation in the concepts in the practical application of data structures and algorithms. This course emphasizes the practical application of techniques for writing and analyzing programs: data abstraction, algorithm verification, and analysis. This course will teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithmic approaches that are appropriate for a given problem that they might encounter in practice. Students will learn practical techniques for reasoning about algorithmic correctness, computational complexities, performance, and various other properties and analyze tradeoffs among various algorithmic strategies. This course provides students a broad mixture of theoretical knowledge complemented with numerous opportunities for practical hands-on experience to apply course concepts.

17-648	Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems	12.0	Software Engineering	Internet services companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance.  These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways.  They are data intensive rather than compute intensive as we see with mainstream super computers spending the bulk of their time performing data I/O and manipulation rather than computation.  They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high reliability and availability demands as well.  Given that they often operate in the commercial space the cost-performance of these systems needs to be such that the organizations dependent on such systems can turn a profit. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover the set of topics needed in order to design and build data intensive scalable systems.  In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance.   Given the large distributed nature of these systems basic distributed systems concepts such as consistency and time and synchronization are also important.  These systems largely operate around the clock, placing an emphasis on operational concerns.  This course will introduce students to these concerns with the intent that they understand the extent to which things like deploying, monitoring, and upgrading impact the design. The course will be a hands-on project oriented course.  The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.  The students will gain exposure to the core concepts needed to design and build such systems as well as current technologies in this space.  Class size will be limited.	Matthew Bass	2<>4	1330	1450	3SC 265
17-651	Models of Software Systems	12.0	Software Engineering	Scientific foundations for software engineering depend on the use of precise, abstract models for describing and reasoning about properties of software systems. This course considers a variety of standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines, algebras, and traces. It shows how different logics can be used to specify properties of systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such as compositionality, abstraction, invariants, non-determinism, and inductive definitions are recurrent themes throughout the course. After completing this course, students will:  1. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of certain models and logics including state machines, algebraic and process models, and temporal logic;  2. Be able to select and describe appropriate abstract formal models for certain classes of systems, describe abstraction relations between different levels of description, and reason about the correctness of refinements;  3. Be able to prove elementary properties about systems described by the models introduced in the course; and  4. Understand some of the strengths and weakness of formal automated reasoning tools.    Prerequisites: Undergraduate discrete math including first-order logic, sets, functions, relations, and simple proof techniques such as induction.   Sections D, PP and G are NOT available for on-campus students.   Admission to the class is by approval from the instructor: If you are not MSE/MSIT-SE/MITS, send email to garlan@cs.cmu.edu for permission to enroll.

17-652	Methods: Deciding What to Design	12.0	Software Engineering	Sections D and PP are NOT available for on-campus students. Practical development of software requires an understanding of successful methods for bridging the gap between a problem to be solved and a working software system. In this course you will study a variety of ways of understanding the problem to be solved by the system youre developing and of framing an  appropriate solution to that problem. After completing this course, you will be able to: identify different classes of problems and their structures; analyze technical, organizational, usability, business, and marketing constraints on solutions; apply engineering approaches to frame solutions; understand how your understanding of the problem should be reflected in the software design. PREREQUISITE: minimum of 3 months hands-on software development experience in industry.  Students not accepted into the MSE program must present a current resume showing relevant industrial experience to department coordinator. This course is offered to only MSE/MITS and MSIT-SE students for fall semester. This course is for graduate students only. This course is for letter grade only (no pass/fail grades). To register for Methods course, you will need a requirement of a minimum of 3 mos hands-on software  development experience in industry.

17-653	Managing Software Development	12.0	Software Engineering	Sections D, F, PP and G are NOT available for on-campus students.  Large scale software development requires the ability to manage resources - both human and computational - through control of the development process. This course provides the knowledge and skills necessary to lead a project team, understand the relationship of software development to overall product engineering, estimate time and costs, and understand the software process.  After completing this course, students will:   1. be able to write a software project management plan, addressing issues of risk analysis, schedule, costs, team organization, resources, and technical approach  2. be able to define the key process areas of the Capability Maturity Model and the technology and practices associated with each and a variety of software development life cycle models and explain the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of each   3. understand the relationship between software products and overall products (if embedded), or the role of the product in the organizational product line  4. understand the legal issues involved in liability, warranty, patentability, and copyright  5. understand the purpose and limitations of software development standards and be able to apply sensible tailoring where needed  6. be able to use software development standards for documentation and implementation   7. be able to apply leadership principles  8. be able to perform requirements elicitation    REQUIREMENT:  Students must have had industrial software engineering experience with a large project, or a comprehensive undergraduate course in software engineering.

17-654	Analysis of Software Artifacts	12.0	Software Engineering	Analysis is the systematic examination of an artifact to determine its properties. This course will focus on analysis of software artifacts--primarily code, but also including analysis of designs, architectures, and test suites. We will focus on functional properties, but also cover non-functional properties like performance and security. In order to illustrate core analysis concepts in some depth, the course will center on static program analysis; however, the course will also include a breadth of techniques such as testing, model checking, theorem proving, dynamic analysis, and type systems.  The course will balance theoretical discussions with lab exercises in which students will apply the ideas they are learning to real artifacts.    After completing this course, students will:     * know what kinds of analyses are available and how to use them     * understand their scope and power,when they can be applied and what       conclusions can be drawn from their results     * have a grasp of fundamental notions sufficient to evaluate new kinds of       analysis when they are developed     * have some experience selecting and writing analyses for a real piece of       software, applying them and interpreting the results    Ph.D. students taking the 17-754 version of the course will gain a broad overview of the analysis research literature and in-depth knowledge of a particular sub-area through a course project.

17-704	Influence and Persuasion Online	6.0	Software Engineering	The marketplace of ideas is moving online.  Social networks play a dominant role in product success, the blogosphere shapes opinion and policy, and internet strategy strongly influences outcomes of elections at all levels.  The Internet makes much more information and opinion available to everyone, but also makes it possible to construct information bubbles that hold divergent opinions at bay.  The course will examine research and practice of influence and persuasion, at the individual, social, and societal levels.  We will examine such questions as What makes web sites credible?  How and why do memes circulate through the blogosphere?  What strategies make Internet-based campaigns successful?  In this course, students will challenged with readings about research and current issues, invited to blog about the topic, and will undertake an individual or team project in an are of interest.

17-791	Software Engineering Seminar	3.0	Software Engineering	The Software Research Seminar (SSSG) at CMU relies on active participation and a supportive community to help students broaden their understanding of software research and hone their presentation skills. This document briefly outlines our expectations for Software Engineering Ph.D. students with respect to SSSG.  General Expectations: A.  Attend both SSSG presentations each week.  B.  Participate by asking questions, contributing to the discussion, and giving constructive verbal and written feedback to presenters. Using an electronic device for purposes other than note-taking or feedback on the presentation is considered to be non-participation.  C.  Give 3 well-prepared SSSG talks per year (2 if giving an approved talk in an outside venue) The faculty recognizes that students may occasionally have conflicts with particular SSSG dates; in these cases the Reasonable Person Principle applies. There may occasionally be a systematic conflict, such as an overlapping course, in which case advance approval should be arranged with advisor and PhD Program Director (but not more than once for any student). In the rare case when a students participation or presentations falls significantly below expectations, the faculty will require remedial action appropriate to the student.  The Seminar is offered for graduate credit, is repeatable, and is intended to be an ongoing activity. PhD students in software engineering are required to register for this seminar on an ongoing basis, and all other graduate students are encouraged to attend.	Jonathan Aldrich	1	1530	1650	NSH 1305

Students learn a systematic approach to requirements elicitation, envisioning, and just-in-time elaboration, while leveraging design-based ideation and validation.  Students apply this knowledge in the context of a semester-long project. Their goal is to define a set of concrete requirements for and create prototypes of a new software system. The system should address a real problem, satisfy real stakeholders needs, and provide a delightful user experience. Students leverage a variety of models and notations for specifying functional requirements, quality attributes, and design constraints. They leverage storyboarding and prototyping for designing the interactions between the users and the system. Students collaborate closely with real stakeholders in different settings for requirements elicitation, solution validation, and usability testing.   Please note that this course is intended for ECE master students with a concentration in Software Engineering and will satisfy the Software Engineering and Design course area requirement.

18-660	Numerical Methods for Engineering Design and Optimization	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	Lecture videos, homeworks and projects will be distributed through the online learning web site. In addition to these, two 1-hour sessions are scheduled for recitation and/or quiz per week.  Each student must attend one of these two sessions every week.    Numerical computation and optimization is an important tool to solve many practical engineering problems. The goal of this course is to teach a number of commonly-used algorithms (e.g., linear/nonlinear solver, matrix computation, nonlinear optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, etc.) and, most importantly, how they can be used to solve practical problems related to electrical and computer engineering. This course will help to develop the mathematical skills to build customized tools, as well as the background required to use commercial solvers.    At the end of this course, students should know the basic algorithms and methodologies for numerical computation and optimization, and implement prototype solvers in MATLAB for these problems. This goal will be achieved by a combination of learning through lectures, homeworks, exams, and importantly, learning to implement numerical algorithms via selected projects. Students will be required to write MATLAB code for computation and optimization tasks. Grades will be based on project results and reports, homeworks, and exams.	Xin Li	NA	NA	NA	NA

18-687	Analytical Performance Modeling & Design of Computer Systems	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	In designing computer systems one is usually constrained by certain performance  requirements. For example, certain response times or throughput might be required of the system. On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? What speed CPU will suffice? Should we invest our money in more buffer space, or a faster processor? Which migration policy will work best? Which task assignment policy will work best? How can we redesign the scheduling policy to improve the system performance? Often answers to these questions are counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system. This class will introduce students to analytic stochastic modeling with the aim of answering questions such as those above. Topics covered include Operational Laws, Markov Chain Theory, Queuing Theory, Modeling Empirical Loads, Simulations, and Management of Server Farms.	Osman Yagan	1<>3	1230	0220	WEH 5328

18-696	Special Topics in Signal Processing: Statistical Learning for Data Science (I)	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	Statistical learning refers to modeling and analyzing complex datasets using a variety of statistical tools. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and especially in machine learning. With the advent of ever-growing Big Data problems, professional people with statistical learning skills are in high demand. Due to the complexity and depth of this discipline, we expect to offer two consecutive courses (I and II) spanning two semesters. This course is designed as an introductory class to statistical learning, with no background in mathematical science required. Topics that will be covered in this course include but are not exclusive to: basics in statistical learning, linear regression (simple linear regression, multiple linear regression), classification (logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor), resampling (cross-validation, permutation test, bootstrapping), and linear model selection and regularization (subset selection, shrinkage method, dimension reduction, high dimensional statistics). Time allowing, we will cover more topics. The programming language R will be introduced and largely used through the entire class. Homework is expected every week.  Some are designed for students to implement the statistical learning algorithms using R.  Grading will be based on participation in class, homework, mid-term exam, and final exam.

18-721	Advanced Analog Integrated Circuits Design	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	This course will familiarize students with advanced analog integrated circuit design issues. Analog circuit design issues play an important role in creating modern ICs.  First and foremost, analog circuits act as the interface between digital systems and the real world. They act to amplify and filter analog signals, and to convert signals from analog to digital and back again.  These analog interfaces appear in all communications devices (e.g., cell phones)   both to condition the transmitted signal and as sensitive receivers.  In addition, these analog interfaces appear in sensors (e.g., accelerometer). The goal of this course is to familiarize students with some of the advanced analog circuit design ideas that are involved in these tasks.  Specific topics will include analog filtering (continuous-time and discrete-time), sample-and-hold amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters.

18-747	Wireless Device Architecture	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	Growth of the Internet of Things depends on semiconductor devices  systems-on-chip (SoC)  with significant computational, communications and sensing capabilities.  Integration of entire systems on one or a very small number of dies has made it possible to deploy hundreds of billions of end-points that will link the cyber world with the physical world.  At this scale, a key design requirement is that such devices can be handled at most once during their lifetime.  Batteries should be life-long, and reprogramming should be over-the-air.  How then should such devices be architected?  We begin by examining modern digital communications including modulation and coding schemes, basic RF subsystems and antennas.  We examine the computational structures that allow us to reduce communication to computation.  Anticipating that such devices will need to be highly programmable, we consider concepts from traditional computer architecture and their applicability to this energy-constrained domain. We also examine the rapid evolution of transducer technologies and how these are being integrated into SoCs.  Then, we consider how an architect can make tradeoffs across these domains to meet design objectives.  Students will take advantage of a purpose-built experimental platform called PowerDu that enables deep exploration of these topics in realistic applications. Background in computer architecture, signals and systems, and EM field theory is recommended.  Graduate standing is required to register for this course.	Robert Iannucci	2<>4	1030	1150	B23 212

18-797	Machine Learning for Signal Processing	12.0	Electrical & Computer Engineering	Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.

Accordingly, high power density welding methods such as electron beam and laser welding will be discussed, along with the characteristic defects.  Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed.  Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials.  Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection.  Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions.  The impact of data science on this area offers many possibilities such as the automatic recognition of materials origin and history.  Finally the context for the course will be discussed, i.e. the rapidly growing penetration of the technology and its anticipated impact on manufacturing.	Itzhaq Cohen-Karni	2<>4	1200	0120	WEH 5403

33-341	Thermal Physics I	10.0	Physics	The three laws of classical thermodynamics, which deal with the existence of state functions for energy and entropy and the entropy at the absolute zero of temperature, are developed along phenomenological lines. Elementary statistical mechanics is then introduced via the canonical ensemble to understand the interpretation of entropy in terms of probability and to calculate some thermodynamic quantities from simple models. These laws are applied to deduce relationships among heat capacities and other measureable quantities and then are generalized to open systems and their various auxiliary thermodynamic potentials; transformations between potentials are developed. Criteria for equilibrium of multicomponent systems are developed and applied to phase transformations and chemical reactions. Models of solutions are obtained by using statistical mechanics and are applied to deduce simple phase diagrams for ideal and regular solutions. The concept of thermodynamic stability is then introduced and illustrated in the context of phase transformations.	Robert Swendsen	1<>3<>5	1330	1420	DH A301D

This course will not review experimental biophysical techniques (which are covered, e.g., in 03-871). Rather, physicists will learn what sets bio apart from the remainder of the Physics world and how the apparent dilemma that the existence of life represents to classical thermodynamics is reconciled. They also will learn the nomenclature used in molecular biology. In turn, biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models, non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different, apparently unrelated phenomena. One major goal is then to merge the two areas, physics an biology, in a unified perspective.	P. Loesche	2<>4	1500	1620	WEH 5304

36-146	Freshman Seminar: Statistics and Human Rights	9.0	Statistics	Statistical analyses can play a crucial role in understanding and combating human rights abuses. Data analyses can tell us how many people were harmed, identify patterns such as whether certain ethnic groups were targeted, and assess whether different stories are consistent with available information.  However, such analyses arent always easy; frequently, human rights data are biased in ways its important to understand and address. In this course, we will explore several real life case studies, examining how statisticians and other researchers are working to combat human rights abuses.  Examples will include recent international criminal trials as well as work to collect data on the needs of populations in conflict and post-conflict settings.  Additionally, we will look at examples of how statistical data has been used to perpetrate abuses, and the need for safeguards.  Students will develop an understanding of when statistical analyses are appropriate in human rights investigations and will be able to articulate what kinds of questions different types of data and analyses can answer.  Additionally, they will be able to critically assess data and numbers presented in news stories and by advocacy groups and whether or not they truly support claims being made.

They apply to situations in which the data cluster naturally into groups of units that are more related to each other than they are the rest of the data. In the first part of the course we will learn about Bayesian statistical methods. In the second part we will relate multilevel and hierarchical models to other areas of statistics, and in the third part of the course we will build and apply these models using a variety of data sets and examples.  Prerequisites: 36-401 (C or better).	Brian Junker	2<>4	1030	1150	DH A302
36-491	Network Models	6.0	Statistics	This course introduces students to a rich statistical literature on the analysis of cross-classified categorical data, i.e., data in the form of a multidimensional contingency table. The typical goal in these analyses is to discover and quantify relationships among categorical variables. Some classic questions that can be approached using methods covered in this course are ``is attitude towards legalized abortion associated with years of schooling or ``is there gender bias in graduate admissions to a certain school. This course will help students develop a critical approach to the analysis of contingency table data, especially using log-linear and logit models. The course will cover basic theory, linking the methods to those of the separate literatures on generalized linear models and graphical models. Students will analyze many different kinds of contingency table data coming from social and biological sciences using various tools in R.

A key component of the course will focus on the practical aspects of HMM implementation including its wide range of applications.	Jordan Rodu	2<>4	1500	1620	PH A18C
36-725	Convex Optimization	None	Statistics	Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints.  This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics.  Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken 10-701 or an equivalent machine learning or statistics class is strongly encouraged, since we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class.  Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester; those wanting to take the class without the project can register under the 9 unit option.

36-759	Statistical Models of the Brain	12.0	Statistics	This new course is intended for CNBC students, as an additional  option for fulfilling the computational core course requirement,  but it will also be open to Statistics and Machine Learning  students. It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.  This course will examine some of the most important methods and  claims that have come from applying statistical thinking	Robert Kass	3<>5	1330	1450	MI 130

45-694	Introduction to Design Thinking & Pactice	6.0	Tepper School of Business	What is Design Thinking?   Design thinking is a discipline that uses the designer?s sensibility and methods to match people?s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity. Tim Brown   Design has its own distinct ?things to know, ways of knowing them, and ways of finding out about them.?  Nigel Cross  Design thinking is the application of integrative thinking to the task of resolving the conflict between reliability and validity, between exploitation and exploration, and between analytical thinking and intuitive thinking. Both ways of thinking require a balance of mastery and originality. Roger Martin  The natural sciences are concerned with how things are? Design, on the other hand, is concerned with how things ought to be... Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. Herbert Simon  Objectives In this course, you will learn about:  ? The techniques designers use to approach ill-defined problems ? The value of user centered design in the context of Jobs to be done ?

[The other introductory course is Entrepreneurial Alternatives (45806)  this course targets entrepreneurial opportunities that include acquisition of businesses, family enterprises, franchises, social ventures and other means by which entrepreneurial principles may be applied].  Each of these two courses serves as a standalone as an introduction to entrepreneurship, and the courses also provide a background for those seeking an entrepreneurship concentration or an in-depth Track immersion.  45805 emphasizes developing an understanding of entrepreneurial thought, mindset, and action, and then progresses thru idea generation, and screening for patterns to predict success, and which underlie entrepreneurial decision making for enterprise creation and growth. The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates, captures, and delivers value to the market.  High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential, typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures). The course also incorporates some fundamental aspects of building a team and financing the opportunity, whether it is a technology-based, venture capital financed opportunity or other ventures more suitable for alternative financing vehicles.

In addition to its focus on business acquisition and franchise purchase, this course will explore other alternative entrepreneurial paths including social entrepreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship.

45-807	Commercialization and Innovation: Strategy	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Commercialization and Innovation, Strategy (45-807) focuses on innovation (transformational or disruptive innovations and by sustained innovations) and on the development of open innovation business models and market strategies required to introduce these innovations into the market, grow thru market share capture, and to establish dominant market positions.  Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.  The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace.  It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).  The goal of the project in Mini 1 is to understand the industry dynamics and competitive set, to identify a market based on use of an agile needs-driven innovation methodology (job + job executor + context defines the market), and to segment the market based on identification of jobs to be done by the job executors. These are the drivers for identification of a successful Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a market entry point, and development of a differentiating strategy and self-sustained growth strategy.

45-812	Market Design	6.0	Tepper School of Business	This course is a masters level course on market design, which is a subfield of applied game theory. The field of market design studies how to design rules for allocating resources or to structure successful marketplaces. While heavily relying on the tools of game theory and mechanism design, it also seeks to identify why certain market rules or institutions succeed and why others fail. Typical examples include governments designing procurement or natural resources auctions, school boards designing centralized clearing-houses for student assignment, and Internet companies such as Google or eBay designing auctions to sell Internet advertisements or objects. Typical objectives of the designers are to maximize efficiency, revenue, and stability or to minimize collusion. In these economic environments, decentralized markets do not work well, mainly either because market prices do not exist or convey all relevant information or decentralized markets work too slowly. Overall, market design is a comparatively new, yet fast growing and exciting field that is motivated by real policy questions.	Isa Hafalir	1<>3	1030	2415	POS 146

45-823	Options	6.0	Tepper School of Business	The primary focus is on pricing and hedging contingent claims -- that is assets with option-like features. Examples include calls, puts, structured products, corporate securities, and real options. The models to be studied include Black-Scholes, binomial, and risk-neutral Monte Carlo pricing. Specific topics include simple no-arbitrage pricing relations (most notably put-call parity), the Greeks (e.g., delta, gamma, theta, vega), implied standard deviations and their statistical properties, exotic options, portfolio insurance and other dynamic option trading strategies, and futures and forward contracts. By its very nature, the course uses mathematics and statistics intensively. However of all subjects in finance, the area of derivatives securities has used these tools to the greatest profit. Our goals are 1) to become proficient at the fundamental option calculations and 2) to take a peak inside the black box so as to understand the pros and cons of the most widely used models.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions	Kaifu Zhang	2<>4	1030	2415	POS 146

45-860	Demand Management and Price Optimization	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Matching supply with demand is an enormous challenge for firms: excess supply is costly, inadequate supply irritates customers and can yield lost revenue opportunities.  In this course we will explore how firms can improve the operational management of the demand for their products (goods or services) to more effectively align it with their supply.  This demand management orientation complements the traditional supply chain management view of operations management.  We will mainly focus on managing demand to meet supply with the goal of maximizing (net) revenue, rather than managing supply to meet demand with the goal of minimizing cost.  The former view is particularly relevant when the firms supply is fixed or relatively inflexible, as in service or service-like operations.  We will also explore opportunities to jointly manage supply and demand with the goal of maximizing margin.	Mustafa Akan	3	1830	2200	POS 146

How to determine what is best is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider some of the issues surrounding successful adoption of quality improvement initiatives   finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs, including six sigma.    We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics   the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a focused discussion of specific six-sigma ideas and techniques, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be very comfortablewith its technical tools.    Other topics we will consider include process capability, setting tolerances, process control, quality in service operations, evaluatory techniques such as the House of Quality, and ISO 9000 certification.

45-875	Government and Business	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Government at all levels can significantly affect business through regulations, international relations, funding, or the myriad of political processes and people. The way your business interacts with government can make you a success or a failure.    Competitive markets are efficient only under certain assumptions. Governments differ in how (and if) they try to create an environment that meets those assumptions. During this course, you will gain an understanding of the factors that drive both businesses and the public to ask for government action, and most importantly, why these actions can vary by country. The overlap between the roles of business and those of government change over time and differ from place to place. The course will examine the cycles of business and government interaction, and evaluate the inputs and outcomes. For example, why does a meeting with an agency head seldom change regulations? What really influences regulatory agencies? Examples will demonstrate how business and governments interact to positively structure complicated problems and become partners for the benefit of all participants.           Some of the course modules will include:                What government attributes are required for efficient markets?    Regulation: why it occurs and disappears, and how to influence regulations and regulators    Management of the commons, incorporation of externalities and congestion    Government, business, and innovation    How taxes and infrastructure investments change the rules of the game	Jerome Apt	1<>3	1330	1515	IA CP AUD

IT not only commands more than a third of firm capital budgets, it also is a major driver of business successes and failures. It is now clear that the road to the digital transformation of businesses unleashed by the Internet and Web will remain bumpy. Some will win big; others may lose it all. Who will win? How do we take advantage of IT? In this course, we address three issues related to these questions.  1.      IT and Business Strategy: What is the role of IT in Business Strategy?  2.       Digital Goods Business: What is the nature of competition in digital goods market?  3.        IT and Firm Boundary: How does IT change Firm Boundary?  Our main objective is to understand the myriad linkages between IT and business strategy. We want to know how to align IT with business strategy?  How does IT transform business processes? What are the implications of IT outsourcing / crowd sourcing? Which IT investments are appropriate?  The bulk of class assignments are team-based. They include case analyses and a team presentation. The balance of the course grade will be determined by class participation and quizzes. This course has no prerequisites.	Tridas Mukhopadhyay	4	2030	2145	NA

Representing your company in external forums is a major executive responsibility but many executives do it poorly. When they speak to external audiences and sometimes to their own employees, executives frequently alienate their listeners.

In this course we?ll talk about why this happens and how to fix it. You will get intense practical training in communicating a concise message under tense or adversarial conditions. You will learn techniques for handling tough questions and for getting your own point-of-view across in any forum where you need to think fast on your feet.     You will also learn to use your voice and body language to reinforce the message you put into words.     We use the process of being interviewed by a reporter as the major vehicle for developing and strengthening your executive communication skills. In the process you will learn how to?      get across to an audience a message that you want to convey about an issue your organization is grappling with      increase your credibility with a skeptical or hostile audience      increase your confidence and poise during interactions with reporters shareholders investment analysts legislators public interest groups or worried employees.

There are five distinct subject headings  1 structure and functioning of capital markets 2 valuation  risk 3 capital structure 4 recapitalization restructuring and incentive signaling and 5 performance measurement.  There are two specific requirements for the course in addition to expected attendance. The first is a paper that will be submitted two weeks prior to the final examination which will be a valuation of a publicly-traded firm. Your task is to compare the value calculated with the actual value and if there is a significant difference you are to explain the principal causes. The second requirement is a final examination. Each will account for 50 percent of the final grade. However the instructor has the option of 10 percentage points based on class participation.	Joel Stern	4	1830	2200	POS 146
45-923	Financial Regulation	6.0	Tepper School of Business	The financial crisis has focused attention on the role of regulation for our financial system and the broader economy.  The course will address the foundations of regulation (why regulate?) from various perspectives within the context of a market economy, highlighting the sources of market failure (such as externalities, adverse selection, and natural monopoly) and potential remedies (such as taxes and fees, disclosure, price regulation, guarantees).  The conflicting goals among regulators (and why we have multiple regulators) and their impact on the meaning of regulation will be considered along with regulatory competition/arbitrage.  Portions of the course will tackle relatively broad questions such as: Why regulate? What is the law of unintended consequences? What is the objective of a policy advocate? Are regulators and regulatory policies a systemic risk? Are our markets rigged? How can regulators enhance the predictability and credibility of their policies? How costly were government guarantees during the financial crisis? Should we bar insider trading? Should regulations be determined and motivated based upon cost-benefit analysis? How can we evaluate the success or failure of particular regulations and whether they have achieved their objectives? How does the Dodd-Frank Act promote financial stability? What basic aspects of the financial crisis did Dodd-Frank not address?  security trading.  How do regulations in these arenas relate to traditional market failures and motives for regulation?

45-932	Customer-Driven Strategies and Services	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Service and e-commerce businesses constitute the majority of interactions for most customers, and most business students will work in service jobs, whether they are in manufacturing, e-com, or service companies. Although businesses give much lip-service to customer satisfaction, too many of these businesses do a poor job of attracting, serving, or retaining these customers. Instead, many companies have overly focused on inserting technology interfaces while under-serving the customer.  Or, they have focused on how they want to approach/manipulate the customer rather than on what the customer wants from the interaction.    This course explores the concepts of customer service and customer-driven within the context of service, e-commerce, and other companies.  It will examine what companies must do to attract, keep, and get repeat business from highly satisfied customers.  It will explore how traditional businesses accomplish these goals and whether traditional concepts/tools apply to e-commerce companies.  When possible, it will highlight traditional and e-commerce companies that provide positive and negative examples.    The course will also distinguish between e-commerce companies that provide a service and those that are customer-driven arms for manufacturing companies.  Even some manufacturing companies (e.g. autos and computers) that traditionally were production or technology driven now find competitive advantage in being customer-driven.  (Ford Motor changed its company slogan from Quality if 1 at Ford to The Customer is 1 at Ford.)  As these companies move into an e-commerce environment, it may require a re-thinking of their business and approach to customers.    Topics that may be included are:      What does it mean to be customer-driven for any business?      How do you (or should you) make your firm more customer-driven?      How does a customer-driven strategy change the way a company positions itse	Robert Kelley	1	1830	2200	POS 153
45-933	Marketing Communication for Consumer Brands	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Marketing communications are the means by which marketers establish and build relationships with consumers through--directly or indirectly-- informing, persuading, and reminding consumers about the brands they sell.    This course is designed to help students develop an integrated marketing communications plan to build enduring brand values. Students will focus on developing an effective MarCom plan and evaluating its effectiveness. The objective is to optimize the effectiveness of a given advertising budget while placing messages for mass or customized audiences by integrating several elements of a promotion mix-advertising, sales promotions, sponsorship, and interactive marketing-based on brand objectives. Whereas advertising is often seen as the central element of a marketing communications mix to build brand equity, it is not usually the only one, and very often not even the most important one.    The course is designed in three parts. Part 1 focuses on frameworks for brand management used to selecting target audiences and set communications objectives. Part 2 focuses on the evaluation of alternative creative messages, testing ad effectiveness, and assessing the effectiveness of the mix as a whole (traditional and non traditional media). The final part of the course discusses non traditional media, and the Internet/changing media environment.	Melissa Murphy	2<>4	1530	1715	POS 146
45-936	Marketing Analytics	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Marketing has become much more quantitative and data intensive in recent years. Strategies like interactive marketing, customer relationship management, and database marketing push companies to utilize the information they collect about their customers in order to make better marketing decisions. Marketing transaction datawhich is a common type of Big Dataoften forms the core set of information used for making marketing decisions. This course focuses on how analytic techniques from data mining, machine learning and statistical modeling can be applied to solve marketing problems.  The approach in this course is to complete a series of data intensive case studies which gives us a hands-on approach to learning marketing analytics.  Each case exposes students to the data, the marketing problem, and a compatible analytical technique.  Specifically, the case studies considered include pricing decision support systems using retail transaction data, understanding customer churn in the cell-phone market, upgrading freemium customers to paying customers, and lifetime cycles in direct marketing. On the analytical side we use regression, mixed models, logistic regression, decision trees, and trial/repeat models.	Alan Montgomery	2<>4	1330	1515	POS 145

45-941	Evidence Based Management	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Contemporary managers and their decisions are heavily swayed by fads and the promises consultants make.  Evidence Based Management (EBM) identifies effective practices, separating them from fads and hype. Managers practicing EBM learn how to obtain and use the best available evidence to inform their decisions, particularly those regarding the workplace, organizational structure, and managing people. EBM means making better quality organizational decisions based on scientific evidence, effective use of business facts, and systematic decision processes. This mini course provides an understanding of the principles of EBM and develops skills in identifying, accessing, and using quality evidence from science and practice in making better decisions.

45-943	Managing Intellectual Capital & Knowledge	6.0	Tepper School of Business	This course will explore three topics:    1) Understanding Intellectual Capital (IC) and its role in the emerging economy.     2) Managing brainpowered businesses (e.g., software, investment banking, professional firms, telecommunications, and health care) and departments (e.g, RD IT, marketing, and finance).    3) Managing the gold collar workers who are the critical resource in brainpowered businesses.    A major premise of the course is that intellectual capital businesses must be managed differently than capital intensive companies. One important difference is that gold collar workers (people whose value to the marketplace is their brainpower) and intelligent technology are the key corporate resources and major competitive weapons. Success also depends upon the organizations ability to create and acquire knowledge that can be easily stored, accessed, and synthesized. If (as the media tells us) knowledge is power, then harnessing this power through sound knowledge management techniques is essential for a brainpowered business.    The class will involve reading and discussion of relative uncharted topics, as well as areas of practical concern to the manager.    These topics may include:    What is Intellectual Capital and is it important?    What new rules drive brainpowered businesses, and how do these differ from the rules for managing traditional industrial or service firms?    How to think about and develop strategies for brainpowered businesses.    How to identify, attract, and retain gold collar workers.    How to measure the performance of a brainpowered business/department and of gold collar workers.    What is the role of intelligent technology, and how do they impact gold-collar workers and brainpowered departments?	Robert Kelley	1	1830	2200	POS 153

45-964	Real Options	6.0	Tepper School of Business	Real options analysis is an approach to the valuation of project cash flows that, different from the static discounted cash flow approach, assumes that managers maximize the market value of projects and they use all the available information when making decisions, in particular when managing projects that involve alternatives, such as, expanding/reducing capacity, investing in new technology, suspending production, and mothballing a plant.  The resulting valuation and managerial decisions can thus be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis.  This course develops a set of essential tools that can be applied to any real options problems.  Various applications, including energy, illustrate the use of these tools in practice.  The emphasis is on developing the student ability to take an unstructured problem and implement real options analysis in a structured manner.	Nicola Secomandi	2<>4	1530	1715	POS 151

The course is intended to teach students the foundations of formal economic analysis in these areas. Emphasis is on precise statements and proofs of some basic propositions in economics.  The treatment of the topics will be fairly mathematical and presumes knowledge of linear algebra, optimization, multivariate calculus and some real analysis. At the end of the course, students should be able to (i) understand theories and concepts in consumer and producer theory, (ii) develop analytical and problem solving skills regarding the analysis of the topics covered, and (iii) be ready to apply these skills in Microeconomics II, General Equilibrium.

This analysis builds on the theories of consumer and producer behavior developed in the study of microeconomics by examining how the interactions of economic agents determine equilibrium in the markets for all goods simultaneously. The starting point for the analysis is the canonical model of general equilibrium known as the Arrow-Debreu model. We will spend much of the course formulating this model, examining its properties, demonstrating existence of equilibrium, and examining properties of the equilibrium prices and allocations.

47-803	Dynamic Competitive Analysis	6.0	Tepper School of Business	The Dynamic Competitive Analysis course examines the two major models of dynamic economic analysis, the neo-classical growth model and the overlapping generations model. The first part of the course develops the multi-sector model of capital accumulation, focusing particularly on the use of forward dynamic programming methods for determining the optimal growth path for the economy. The second half of the course focuses on the overlapping generations model. OLG models incorporate the important heterogeneities associated with the human life-cycle, and the economic phenomenon this entails.	Stephen Spear	1<>3	1530	1720	POS 147
47-811	Econometrics I	6.0	Tepper School of Business	This course is an introduction to the basic questions, tools and techniques used in empirical social science research.   Students will learn to calculate and perform correct inference on parameter estimates. The course focuses on the multivariate linear model. Topics include: consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter estimates, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing parameter restrictions and specification tests. Students will learn the impact of departures from traditional assumptions in the linear model (e.g. correlated errors, heteroscedastic errors, correlation between the regressors and the errors) and how to address these situations.  Students are expected to be familiar with multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and basic probability and statistics.  Students will write MATLAB programs on problem sets.

47-812	Econometrics II	6.0	Tepper School of Business	This course is about estimating structural economic models. The basic question is how to use data to estimate the parameters of an economic model. We will want to establish:  1. establish the consistency of the estimators,  2. establish the asymptotic normality of the estimators,  3. the data has been used as efficiently as possible in terms of obtaining the smallest possible variance of the asymptotic distribution, and  4. test hypothesis about the parameters. We would like to use economic theory to restrict our estimation problem so that we has as much structure as possible implied by theory. Students should learn how to establish the consistency and asymptotic normality for parameters estimated from nonlinear objective functions. The students should also learn how to calculate the parameter estimates and perform inference.	Karam Kang	1<>3	1530	1720	POS 147
47-818	Economics of Contracts	6.0	Tepper School of Business	This course will cover the basics of contract theory and its application to economic problems. A contract is a set of rules that facilitates interaction among individuals beyond the simplest forms of barter. You have already encountered simple contracts; for example, in the form of spot labor contracts (exchanging leisure for goods) or borrowing and saving agreements (exchanging resources today for resources tomorrow). This course studies more involved contracts. The basic setup will feature the parties involved in the contract having conflicting objectives. In addition contracting will be limited by two types of frictions: we will look at environments where a party in the contract has some valuable, privately observed information; and we will consider environments where at least one party in the contractual relationship cannot credibly commit to it.

48-095	Spatial Concepts for Non-Architects I	None	Architecture	This course serves as an introduction to the spatial concepts of architecture for students from other disciplines. The course is focused entirely on project design work (this is not an historical survey, technical or lecture course). This course is very hands-on  Projects will explore the design and experience of spatial environments through a series of creative investigations. The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required. Students are expected to perform work both inside and outside of class. Students should be prepared to purchase various supplies throughout the course. This course is in partial fulfillment of requirements for an Architecture Minor.	Nina Marie Barbuto	2<>4	1330	1620	MM 321
48-100	Architecture Design Studio: Foundation I	12.0	Architecture	As the first architectural design studio course, the Foundation I studio establishes a fundamental understanding of representation and abstraction to which more of your own thoughts and ideas about spatial thinking can be added. This will involve, by means of the architectural studio, a reiterative investigation into the relationship of technique, form, and meaning through study, invention, testing, and evaluation. During this semester a series of short problems will be given to expose you to the complexities of visual communication and the design act; to develop skills of spatial manipulation; to give you the self-confidence in making valid decisions within set time limits; to develop the skills of graphic presentation necessary for interpreting and communicating your architectural intentions; and above all, to instill the ability to combine insight with the rigorous analytical study in a ?design process? that is efficient, personally effective, and which becomes second nature to you as a working process.

48-120	Analog and Digital Media I	12.0	Architecture	IDM is a required course for all first year architecture students.  The course introduces students to a wide range of digital methods and concepts available to architects for design, representation, and documentation.  The coursework is directly coordinated with Studio assignments providing the students with the opportunity to master their digital skills in a meaningful manner.  Due to the amount of content covered there is no single text for this course, but the course is supported by materials created by the instructor.    IDM addresses topics such as digital image editing, vector illustration, HTML coding, and 3D modeling.	Man Kim<>Gerard Damiani	1	1030	1120	MM 103
48-121	Analog Media I	6.0	Architecture	Architects draw and build models for a variety of reasons: to record and reference; to analyze and reveal order, intent, and relationships; to speculate; and to visualize new propositions. The study of architecture requires the connection between the mind, the eye and the hand, so that the nature of ideas and their relationship to physical form can be investigated. The connection of the mind, hand and drawing skills requires considerable time and effort. This course introduces why architects use these forms of representation. Students are introduced to how to do basic academic research as well direct assignments that apply the fundamentals of freehand drawings and drafting techniques as it pertains to plans, sections, elevations and paraline drawing, analytical diagraming and model making.

48-200	Architecture Design Studio: Elaboration I	18.0	Architecture	This studio is an introduction to architectural design stressing concept generation and the development of a rich design process to create evocative spatial experiences through architecture.  Building on the explorations of form and space in the 1st year, we investigate in greater depth the role that program, context, and the physical elements of architecture play in creating meaningful architecture.   We seek to understand design principles underlying the buildings of the past and present, from the broadly theoretical and conceptual, to the real implications of tectonics and sustainability, and apply these ideas with intent and significance.  We will focus on developing challenging architectural ideas, profound building details, and effective ways of communicating them in order to explore architectures potential for creating poetic expressions, appropriate shelter, or exalted experiences, as well as its ability to embody ideas and impart meaning to the world around us.

It focuses attention on the 20th-century, and investigates the web of interwoven ideas and issues that characterize the modern age and ?modernism.?  We begin with a look at the crisis of modernity that plagued most of western civilization in the late 19th-century, and then survey the major movements of the avant-garde and other responses to modernity, and end with what came to be known as ?Post-Modernism.?  We will look more closely at the increasing divide between the ?disciplinary? edge of architecture, and architecture?s increasing ?professionalization? in the last century, focusing on how architecture has influenced culture through experimentation and provocative thinking, even when the primary intent was functional, technological, social, political, etc. Emphasis will be placed on the relationship of buildings to the more general cultural, intellectual, and historical circumstances in which they were created.  Special attention will be devoted to the important manifestoes, theoretical, and critical writings that so determined the project of modern architecture.	Kai Gutschow	1<>3<>5	1030	1120	MM A14

Students will be expected to combine an understanding of the basic laws of comfort and heat flow with the variables of local climate to create energy design guidelines for their own work. The state of the art in building energy conservation and passive heating and cooling technologies will be presented, with take-home readings and assignments. To stress the significance of architectural design decision-making on energy consumption and comfort, full design specifications and calculations will be completed for a residential-scale building. Students will compile a professional energy consultants report, designing the most viable energy conservation retrofit measures for their client from siting, massing, organization, enclosure detailing, opening control, to passive system integration and management. An overview of world energy consumption in buildings and energy design standards will be challenged by lectures on building energy  conservation successes, and emerging demands for a broader definition of sustainability. The course will end with a focus on the design integration of natural conditioning systems and the potentially dynamic interface of mechanical systems in small- and large-scale buildings.

48-348	Architectural History of Mexico & Guatemala	9.0	Architecture	This course surveys the architecture and urbanism of Mexico and Guatemala from prehistory to the 20th century, focusing on three critical periods of their cultural history and architectural development: (1) the Pre-Columbian development of Mesoamerica, primarily Maya and Aztec, (2) the Spanish colonial architecture and urbanism of the 16th-18th centuries, and (3) the 20th-century search for an appropriate regional and national modernism. When the Spanish conquistador Hernn Corts landed in 1519 in what is now Mexico, he encountered one of the world?s largest and most spectacular civilizations. The Aztec empire, however, was only the latest urban civilizations in a Mesoamerican tradition that stretched back more than 2,000 years. The ensuing European architectural and urban imprints can be seen as both a victory of colonialism?s political, social, and architectural ideals, and as a fusion combining European practices with indigenous conditions and traditions. Centuries later, as 20th-century Latin Americans grappled with the challenges of industrialization, economic swings, and political and social revolutions, architects, planners, and clients again sought to reconcile competing visions of national and modern identities.  Student work will include a research paper and several shorter written assignments throughout the semester.	Diane Shaw	2<>4	1500	1620	CFA 102
48-355	Perspective	9.0	Architecture	Course addresses perspective on the basis of three distinct understandings of perceptual psychology:    1) A Kinesthetic Basis for Perspective, which is built on the drawing pedagogy of Kimon Nicholaides.  It aligns with the transactionalist understanding of perception and considers perspective as partly invented and partly discovered truth.     2)The Order of Appearance, which is built on the early work of the perceptual psychologist, J.J. Gibson, and aligns with the ecological  position of Gibson and his followers  It considers perspective as an absolute truth of the visual field.    3)Perspective Imposed, which aligns implicitly with the position of Gestalt  psychology.  It treats perspective as an imposed schema.      Along the way some use is made of on-going design work for subject material.  Work is submitted in 3 portfolio submissions of 3-4 weeks duration each.

48-470	Exploring Pattern Through Lamination	6.0	Architecture	Lamination is the process of gluing wood together along the edge or face of a plank. Pattern may be generated in unlimited variety through this process following standard rules of wood working. Generally lamination is unidirectional, however, in this class we will introduce ways to achieve cross directional patterning and the use of inlay to elaborate on the pattern. Topics will be demonstrated in class and assignments relating to the demonstrations will be issued. When demonstrations don?t take the entire class the students will work under the instructor?s supervision. Students should come to each class prepared to work. Multiple assignments will be given throughout the course. While assignments are process driven, thoughtful, well crafted execution reflecting good design is critical.   Projects: Projects will be visual statements. Their function will be limited. They will not be furniture. Each exercise will present a series of basic wood working operations, which, when repeated and recombined will become products of compelling visual character. As visual idea statements you will be asked to experiment, invent and explore and take these standard operations in new directions. But as visual idea statements the greatest clarity of vision will be achieved through careful construction.	Scott Smith	2<>4	1030	1150	CFA SHOP
48-473	Hand and Machine Joinery, New Directions	6.0	Architecture	Hand and Machine Joinery, New Directions is offered in the second half of the fall semester. As the course name suggests, it will teach hand and machine methods for making the basic joints of stick construction in woodworking: the mortise and tenon and the dovetail, while also exploring unique joints which are derived from hand tools, or power tools techniques. It will explore variations in these basic joints which can be altered to meet the myriad unique situations of furniture making. Variations include perpendicular and angled joints with two, three, and more intersecting members.  Emphasis will be placed on developing hand tool skills with the chisel, plane, and saw. Sharpening of hand tools will be demonstrated and students will be required to sharpen the tools they use. Joints and fabrication techniques will be demonstrated in class and assignments relating to them will be issued. Demonstrations may not take the entire class time in which case the students will work for the remainder of class time under the instructor?s supervision. In class work is an important component of the class, and out of class assignments are also required.  Assignments will consist of practice exercises and joints in large stock of softer hardwoods to develop hand and machine skills and knowledge of layouts. Attention will be directed to grain direction, orientation of faces and edges to maximize strength, and accommodation of later actions performed on the intersecting parts (like carving and shaping). The final grade will be based on submission of all assignments, quality of workmanship, and uniqueness of design.  This mini course will focus on the development of skills however there will be constant opportunity to incorporate and refine design. There will be hard labor through which you will develop blisters, calluses, muscle, dexterity, and perseverance. You will also develop knowledge of materials and techniques.

48-493	Representing Activism	9.0	Architecture	Efforts to promote social, political, economic and environmental change can range in form from written word to direct action. Sources of injustice are multi-dimensional and complex. Effective forms of activism are fueled by creativity that synthesize and distill complex constellations of information and foster understanding. REPRESENTING ACTIVISM explores the role of multi-media graphic representation as a lens through which to effect change and social justice. Modes of representation explored will span four dimensions, 1) Social Media, 2) Film, 3) Graphic Design, and 4) Technical Delineation.	John Folan	1<>3<>5	1230	0120	CFA 200

48-531	Fabricating Customization	9.0	Architecture	This course relocates the design process from the studio to the lab-workshop, moving design decisions upstream to include considerations of tooling and material processing as inputs for design experimentation. Students in this course will work in partnerships to explore novel methods of robotic metal sheet forming that are borne out of direct experimentation with industrial robotic arms and customized metal forming tools. We will operate in response to two primary motivations: 1. Explore novel methods of customizable robotic metal sheet forming. 2. Speculate upon the potential application of the results at the building scale.  Our work will leverage the robustness and precision of industrial robotic arms in conjunction with rule-based, computationally generated geometry to explore highly customizable alternatives to long-standing massproduction metal forming techniques.  In situating this as an open-ended series of design experiments, rather than product designs, we seek to produce artifacts that reveal the methods of their production and uniqueness of their material character, while suggesting potential applications at the building scale.

48-795	LEED, Green Design and Building Rating in Global Context	6.0	Architecture	LEED, Green Design and Building Rating in Global Context is a graduate level mini-course that examines holistic, integrated strategies for sustainable building design, construction and operation. The course is organized within the framework of the US Green Building Council?s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Rating System: location, site, water, energy, materials, and the interior environment. Within that framework, we explore strategies promoted within LEED and compare/contrast them with strategies in the rating systems of other countries. We also consider additional ways to encourage development of better buildings, e.g., codes and standards, incentives, and project delivery methods. The course focuses on the concepts underlying rating system credits, the national contexts that can produce different rating systems, and substantive improvement in building performance. This course provides the foundation for taking USGBC?s LEED Green Associate exam. More importantly, students who successfully complete the course will understand buildings? powerful impact on the environment and equally powerful strategies to address those impacts. There are no prerequisites for this course.  However, because the course moves quickly and we are discussing improvements to building practice, a basic knowledge of the vocabulary, design, construction and operation of buildings is assumed.

51-173	Human Experience in Design	9.0	Design	This course introduces the central themes of design and the design professions, and the human centered focus in all aspects of design thinking and practice. We will begin by exploring the nature of having an experience, followed by the broad philosophy of design in relationship to other areas of human activity, the sciences and the arts. We will explore design through its orders of activity: first in communication and second the creation of physical objects. But design has a far greater reach into the intangible and more complex areas of human activity: interaction, systems, environments, and culture. These are the topics of inquiry for design and, unlike what the patchwork of professions would have you believe, are not fixed by boundaries. Design is enormously broad and something everybody participates in as we create the artificial world in which we live. Those who call themselves designers have greater power in shaping this world and for that reason we will end the course with a discussion of ethics. Non-Design majors are welcome.

51-321	Photographic Narrative	9.0	Design	Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives. In this course, students will make a photo narrative and determine how it will be seen.  Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen digitally on screen. While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photographic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who construct fictional worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, and Gregory Crewdson. As students make their own narratives, we will look at the interplay  between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create rhythm; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives. 12-15 students. Prerequisite-a college level photography course.	Charlee Brodsky	5	0830	1120	MM 121

51-425	Beginning Book Arts Lab	6.0	Design	Beginning Book Arts Lab Class.  6units.  (This class is a prerequisite for the  Advanced Book Arts Workshop Lab Class).    This is a class of basic issues regarding hand bookbinding  and letterpress printing. Its purpose is to develop a basic  structural sense of book forms, of flat format work and of three  dimensional forms. Learning hand craft techniques, developing  hand skills and the sensitivity to materials are also a goal.  Binding projects assigned will target the unique nature of  papers, fabrics and archival card-boards. Structural procedures  and techniques will be identified with each assigned binding project.  The binding projects will be:  A hardcover for a paper back book,  a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine,  and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted  to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book  form, or as a set of un-bound pages.  The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique  to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast  metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press,  proofing, and production printing. Each semester a small class  edition project of text content and image, in two-color  registration, is designed, hand set and printed.  Image generation can be by hand cut block, assembled  type-high forms, or digital process to polymer plate.    This class is not to be repeated.	Joseph Dicey	NA	NA	NA	MM B8
51-427	Advanced Book Arts Workshop	9.0	Design	Students will be required to plan and design projects that relate to binding, or digital printing, or letterpress printing, or hand-setting of cast metal type. Projects utilizing a combination of all processes can be planned as well. Experimental work, or Artists Books are also encouraged. In this class structure students will be able to plan and design projects that are complete books, with printed content, or with out content. Other flat structures, and three dimensional containers are examples of general forms that will be categorized as binding work. Students who wish to enroll in this course must have already taken Beginning Book Arts, and must also speak to the instructor directly about project ideas.  Emphasis for binding is working independently with a greater level of hand craft and a sensitivity to materials.  Emphasis for letterpress printing is to learn in depth, and master, the general mechanical process for doing press work.  Emphasis for hand typesetting is on gaining an understanding of the system of cast metal type, and to develop a sensitivity to typographic principles.  Instruction will be given on an individual basis through consultation at strategic times throughout the semester. Project evaluation will be based on the success of the project work compared to each students written project proposal at the start of the semester.  The Advanced Workshop in Book Arts can be repeated. For more complex project work this class can be continued for the following semester.	Joseph Dicey	NA	NA	NA	NA

51-673	Human Experience in Design	12.0	Design	This course introduces the central themes of design and the design professions, and the human centered focus in all aspects of design thinking and practice. We will begin by exploring the nature of having an experience, followed by the broad philosophy of design in relationship to other areas of human activity ? the sciences and the arts. We will explore design through its orders of activity: first in communication and second the creation of physical objects. But design has a far greater reach into the intangible and more complex areas of human activity: interaction, systems, environments, and culture. These are the topics of inquiry for design and, unlike what the patchwork of professions would have you believe, are not fixed by boundaries. Design is enormously broad and something everybody participates in as we create the artificial world in which we live. Those who call themselves designers have greater power in shaping this world and for that reason we will end the course with a discussion of ethics.	Brett Yasko	1	1830	2120	MM A14

51-825	MDES Seminar III: Advanced Interaction & Service Design Concepts	12.0	Design	This seminar is an exploration of the leading edge of current interaction design practice. Most of these new developments reflect the conflicting ways in which the work of interaction designers is expanding in scope whilst also speeding up. This necessitates that designers understand more non-design domains of knowledge, for instance, in relation to domains of cultural difference, organizational change, business strategy, risk management. It also demands that designers pay more attention to processes and organizations - their own as professional designers, but also those of their clients and stakeholders. And it requires that interaction designers have a better understanding of their profession within wider socio- economic transformations. The course will involve a range of readings with participants required to develop public positions on emerging design practice trends. To this end, the course will teach multi-modal social media communication techniques. It will also involve developing research-based strategies for helping complex organizations in transition.

52-190	BXA Seminar I: Building the Wunderkammer	9.0	BXA Intercollege Degree Programs	BXA Seminar I introduces first-year and rising sophomore internal transfer students to the field of interdisciplinary work through the concept of the Wunderkammer, the cabinet of wonders. How do we identify and categorize objects? How do we define their position in the world and in a collection? What kind of knowledge is conveyed through context, representation, and juxtaposition? This class considers how interdisciplinary work can be produced, analyzed, justified, and--most importantly--contextualized. Students engage with theoretical and practical readings from across disciplines, with particular emphasis on interpretive theory. Weekly readings in aesthetic and critical theory introduce students to a particular vocabulary of analysis, practiced in class discussion and written responses. Students will conceive, research, produce, and present a creative final project at the end of the semester.	M. Stephanie Murray	5	1130	1320	CFA 307

53-371	Role Playing Games Writing Workshop	12.0	Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh	Role playing games-mainly traditional pencil-and-paper, but recently, video game RPGs as well-have matured over the last 40 years into a viable medium for modern interactive storytelling. There is now a generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers who first honed their story-telling chops when they were a Gamesmaster of a Role Playing Game (RPG). The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course.	Gerard Klug	2<>4	1030	2420	HL 106B

The class will also explore the analytics of the experience.  Lectures and discussions will focus on the importance of theming, guest experience, thru put and safety.  Existing events and installations will be used as case studies.    There will be two projects completed by the entire class over the semester.  (1) The class, as a team, will work with an existing client and provide a pre-show experience for guests attending a public event.  As part of this project, the class will work with the client to see how the event is put together, advertised, executed, and then fully analyze the flow and thru put of the event and overall guest reaction to the experience; (2) The class, as a team, will work with the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) as their client to organize, execute, and analyze use of the ETC spaces during the Building Virtual Worlds Festival.

53-689	Entertainment Technology Center Independent Study	None	Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh	For ETC students   Independent study is available for students who are in good academic standing. Independent study allows the student, with the support of a faculty advisor, to develop a self-generated project or body of work outside the classroom or project course setting. In order to register for an independent study, the student must first propose their idea to a faculty member (who does not have to be from our department) who agrees to oversee the project, and then fill out the appropriate paperwork available from the Director of Student Services.     For non-ETC students   The Entertainment Technology Center offers independent study opportunities to non-ETC students on a very limited basis. Registering for the independent study allows students, in essence, to work be a part of ETC project course in which ETC students are in small, interdisciplinary teams, creating artifacts under direct faculty supervision. The number of projects per semester will vary. The primary objective of the courses is to provide a hands-on working experience with teammates who are from different backgrounds and disciplines. Other objectives are to experience project management, and have the possibility of working with an external client (some projects have external collaborators). The requirements for a project are that: the team contain students from both technology and non-technology backgrounds, the team must prototype and produce a tangible artifact (not a paper), and the work must be supervised by a faculty member approved by the ETC for this project.  Registration to the course requires a completed independent study work outline.  See the ETC Director of Student Services for the form.	David Culyba<>Jesse Schell	NA	NA	NA	NA

53-831	Building Virtual Worlds	24.0	Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh	This is a project course, where interdisciplinary teams build rapidly prototyped immersive interactive virtual worlds. The course will cover world building, environmental design, non-linear storytelling, and related topics. Students will use modeling tools, paint tools, sound processing tools, and the Unity game engine in conjunction with cutting-edge interface hardware. At the end of the semester, we hold an exhibition on campus to show class projects to the Carnegie Mellon community. The goal of the course is to take students with varying talents, backgrounds, and perspectives and put them together to do what they couldnt do alone.   The course is primarily for ETC graduate students, but occasionally other students are admitted by special permission from the instructors. To enroll, students must have ONE of the following skills: 3D modeling, high quality 2D art skills,strong programming skills, or the ability to compose and record original music and/or sound effects. The key is that there are no idea people in the course; everyone must share in the mechanical creation of the worlds. Students in the course may be assigned to a role that is not their primary skill set due to the distribution of the enrollees. This is a hands-on course and it takes a lot of time, but most students find it very fulfilling and fun. Note that we dont try to teach artists to program, or engineers to paint; we form teams where everyone does what theyre already skilled at to attack a joint project. Class time includes a split between regular lectures, display/critique of group projects, guest lectures and workshops designed to aid in world creation. Significant out-of-classroom time is required at the ETC working with your group, and non-ETC students must be sure to contact the faculty before the semester begins to get clarity on what time in class will be required.

53-871	Role Playing Game Writing Workshop	12.0	Entertainment Technology Pittsburgh	Role playing games mainly traditional pencil-and-paper, but recently, video game RPGs as well  have matured over the last 40 years into a viable medium for modern interactive storytelling. There is now a generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers who first honed their story-telling chops when they were a Gamesmaster of a Role Playing Game (RPG). The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course. To gain final admittance to the class you must submit an original two-page sample original dramatic scene (TV, Screenplay, Stage Play) to the instructor.	Gerard Klug	2<>4	1030	2420	HL 106B

54-399	Decoding Media	6.0	Drama	The entire theatrical process can be considered as a series of decodings and re-encodings, first decoding the text (by the creative team), re-encoding (the design  direction) and finally decoding by the audience.

This class is designed to give students a solid foundation in contemporary media design skills while simultaneously providing an examination of the function of theater historically and the ways media technologies fill those needs today.  Early assignments focus on students use of media in their everyday lives, by keeping media journals and bringing in media objects for examination. Later classes focus on taking ideas from this research and applying them in conceptual stage designs for an early Greek play, a contemporary adaptation and then a play of the students choosing. The class covers technical and conceptual basics from text analysis, research, storyboarding and analyzing dramatic structure to understanding screen/surface characteristics; video cue building; projection optics; and creating projection plots and other tools for communication with team members. Class assignments focus on the creation of dramatically relevant media-worlds and communicating these design ideas verbally, visually and in written documentation.

54-498	Expanded Theater Fusion Studio	10.0	Drama	As the boundaries between theater, art, entertainment and everyday life continue to expand through engagement with new technologies, it is critical that emerging artists and technologists be provided with the tools, language, and vision to thrive in the new millennium.  Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems. Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways.  Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach.  Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each students individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellons Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception.

There is now a generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers who first honed their story-telling chops when they were a Gamesmaster of a Role Playing Game (RPG). The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course. To gain final admittance to the class you must submit an original two-page sample original dramatic scene (TV, Screenplay, Stage Play) to the instructor.	Gerard Klug	2<>4	1030	2420	HL 106B

54-798	Expanded Theater Fusion Studio	12.0	Drama	As the boundaries between theater, art, entertainment and everyday life continue to expand through engagement with new technologies, it is critical that emerging artists and technologists be provided with the tools, language, and vision to thrive in the new millennium.  Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems.  Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways.  Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach.  Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience.  Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each students individual discipline.  The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellons Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration.  Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication.  The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception.

54-899	Graduate Decoding Media	None	Drama	The entire theatrical process can be considered as a series of decodings and re-encodings  first decoding the text (by the creative team), re-encoding (the design  direction) and finally decoding by the audience. And the media design process itself requires a sophisticated grasp of multiple layers of encoding and decoding  technically, conceptually and experientially.  This class is designed to give students a solid foundation in contemporary media design skills while simultaneously providing an examination of the function of theater historically and the ways media technologies fill those needs today.  Early assignments focus on students use of media in their everyday lives, by keeping media journals and bringing in media objects for examination. Later classes focus on taking ideas from this research and applying them in conceptual stage designs for an early Greek play, a contemporary adaptation and then a play of the students choosing. The class covers technical and conceptual basics from text analysis, research, storyboarding and analyzing dramatic structure to understanding screen/surface characteristics; video cue building; projection optics; and creating projection plots and other tools for communication with team members. Class assignments focus on the creation of dramatically relevant media-worlds and communicating these design ideas verbally, visually and in written documentation.

57-143	Elective Studio (Alexander Technique I)	3.0	Music	The Alexander Technique is a dynamic and powerful process of education that gives us a practical knowledge of simple yet profound principles which govern human co-ordination. This process teaches us to observe and experience how we approach our lives, both physically and mentally. The technique enables us to recognize and release patterns of tension by redirecting excessive effort into useful energy, resulting in improved balance, flexibility and co-ordination. We learn how to transform tension into attention, fatigue into kinesthetic lightness. Through observation, discussion, functional anatomy, and gentle hands-on guidance, we regain deep structural support and experience a sense of freedom and the sheer pleasure of movement.   This is a studio mini-course. One section meets during the first half of the semester; the other section meets during the second half of the semester. Each section can have 3-4 students. There is a 225.00 studio fee; it is non-refundable, in order for the fee to be as low as possible.	Lisa Levinson	3	1930	2120	MM 127

57-947	Sound Recording	6.0	Music	Sound Recording (57337, 57947) centers around the Vlahakis Recording Studio in the College of Fine Arts: how the studio works, and how to record various types of music. The method of instruction is to learn by doing, and the goal is to achieve professional-sounding results.   Equipment includes a complete 24-track Pro-Tools system, professionally designed control room that can accommodate up to 24 people, outboard preamps and other gear, and an interesting array of microphones. All recording is direct to hard disc. Grading is based on recording projects, class attendance, mastering studio hardware and software, and several quizzes.	Schulz	1	1830	1950	CFA A6
57-948	Sound Editing and Mastering	6.0	Music	The raw recording is just the first step in the process of creating a professional finished audio product.  Editing is the art of piecing together different takes to make one final good take.  Mastering is the art of polishing the good take to perfection--balancing all the instruments and tracks, adding special effects, setting final levels.  If recording seems like an high-energy activity--involving engineers, musicians, producers--editing and mastering are the necessary counterparts--long tedious hours of solitary confinement honing the skills of the mastering engineer.  Those taking this course are expected to have significant music skills: actively playing a musical instrument (or composition), and/or the ability to read a piano score at the least, and a full orchestra score from any recent century, including our own, at the most.

60-212	Electronic Media Studio: Interactivity and Computation for Creative Practice	10.0	Art	This is an intermediate level course in creative coding, interactive new-media art, and computational design. Ideal as a second course for students who have already had one semester of elementary programming (in any language), this course is for you if youd like to use code to make art, design, architecture, and/or games -- AND youre already familiar with the basics of programming, such as for() loops, if() statements, and arrays.   This course satisfies the EMS-2 (60-210: Interactivity) requirement for BFA and BXA-Art majors. As with EMS-2, students in this course will develop an understanding of the contexts, tools, and idioms of software programming in the arts. Unlike EMS-2, this course additionally satisfies the computing portal requirement for CFA and Dietrich students pursuing IDeATe minors and concentrations. (Students with no prior programming experience should register instead for 15-104, 15-110, or 15-112.)  This is a studio art course in computer science, in which the objective is art and design, but the medium is student-written software. The course develops skills and understanding of text-based, imperative programming techniques in a variety of popular open-source arts-engineering toolkits, including p5.js (JavaScript), Processing (Java), and openFrameworks (C++), with the aim of applying such skills to interactive art and design, information visualization, generative media, and other creative cultural practices.   Rigorous programming exercises will develop the basic vocabulary of constructs that govern static, dynamic, and interactive form. Topics include the computational manipulation of: point, line and shape; texture, value and color; time, change and motion; reactivity, connectivity and feedback; interactive graphics, sound, and simulation; and the incorporation of various modes of input (sensors, cameras) and multimedia output.

60-223	IDeATE: Introduction to Physical Computing	10.0	Art	[IDeATe portal course] Physical computing refers to the design and construction of physical systems that use a mix of software and hardware in order to sense and respond to the surrounding world. Such systems include digital+physical toys and gadgets, kinetic sculpture, functional sensing and assessment tools, mobile instruments, interactive wearables, etc. This is a project-based course that deals with all aspects of conceiving, designing and developing projects with physical computing: the application, the artifact, the computer-aided design environment, and the physical prototyping facilities. The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time. The course is organized around a large set of essential skills that students must gain in order to effectively tackle physical computing problems. It is then deployed through a series of quick group projects that utilize the essential skills and challenge students to not only consider HOW to make things, but also for WHOM we design, WHEN the time is ripe, and WHY the making is worthwhile/necessary.

60-354	Aesthetics of Dysfunction: Failed Spectacles, Disasters, & Technology Breakdowns	9.0	Art	An Aesthetics of Dysfunction is a study of the sublime and often ridiculous (or incredulous) moments of technological breakdowns, urban and rural disasters, or sudden blows to authority and power of cultural or political icons. The questions we ask change and become immediate since the World Trade Center tragedy (and the ensuing Iraq War): What happens to a great object or event after it has failed or fallen? How does it enter our memory in aesthetic terms? Is an aestheticization of something lost or failed a way of coping with (or regaining) the kind of time that existed before a moment of failure? What happens to this event when it is reenacted in artistic practice (i.e., when art becomes/is dangerous)? In particular, we will explore the aesthetic dimensions of supposed greatness, i.e., technological wonders, empires, icons of beauty, architectural feats. We will also explore how B-Aesthetics (i.e., B-Movies, B-Actors, etc.) are established and how they cross over both popular culture and high art practices.  We will examine the ethical debates which have arisen out of art projects which flirt with danger (both literal and metaphoric) as well as aestheticize personal tragedies or social and political disasters. In brief, this is primarily a film and video class: it explores questions of spectacle, disaster, and modernity through the lenses of several theoretical models: Virilio, Freud, Lacan, Bataille, and Blanchot. Its central question asks: How is modernity constructed around various levels of crisis or catastrophe as represented in film and popular culture?	Melissa Ragona	3	1830	2120	CFA 303
60-362	Art Writer	9.0	Art	ART WRITER will strive to bring together the intersecting discourses of artists use of writing as an object, art criticism, as well as experiments by both artists and critics to use theory as invention. The idea of experiment implied here emphasizes the urgency that art writing move beyond its own history, beyond the received understanding of its proper practices in order to propose new modes of critical reflection. The form and material force of language will be explored through the conceptual and critical work of Dan Graham, Lawrence Wiener, Donald Judd, Lee Lozano, Joseph Kosuth, Vito Acconci, Mel Bochner, Eleanor Antin, the international projects of Art and Language, Fluxus, as well as more recent iterations. This is a writing intensive seminar with experimentation at its core. Members will workshop their writing: revise, rethink, perform, and publish.	Melissa Ragona	2	1830	2120	CFA 303
60-388	Outside/Inside the Box - Sculptures' Expanded Field of Installation/Site Art	6.0	Art	Site-specific art emerged after the modernism as a reaction of artists to the gallery/museum situations in the world. Modernist art objects  were transportable, nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and co-modification. Since 1960s the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around a specific site.  Installation Art is a pervasive, varied and global practice for art making that acts as a gathering place for expression in all media, addressing all subjects in a wide range of styles by broad grouping of artists. It collapses traditional media boundaries and discipline boundaries.    In this class we will address some of the historical, conceptual, and theoretical aspects of contemporary art while studying a broad range of Site-Specific Art and Installation work. Questions we will explore include, if this category of art making is so broad, how is it different  from other forms of visual art? How can we define it at all? During the course students will explore the history of installation art as a genre  of art making that encourages invention and new ways of thinking about presentation and communication of ideas.  Site and Installation Art is based on the merger of Space and Time and on a relationship between the artist, space and the visitor. It continues to change over time, from early Dada exhibitions to community-involved constructions as found in Relational and Community Contextual practices. New Technology has become a vital tool for artists working in this genre.  The idea that materials and concepts are brought together in a temporary construction is something that is typical of most of this art.  Besides formal lectures, speakers and films the students will collaborate on creating temporary, site-specific installations to be erected in spaces on campus and other sites.

60-446	Advanced SIS: Expanded Theater Fusion Studio	10.0	Art	[IDeATe collaborative course] As the boundaries between theater, art, entertainment and everyday life continue to expand through engagement with new technologies, it is critical that emerging artists and technologists be provided with the tools, language, and vision to thrive in the new millennium. Expanded Theater will reanimate classical modes of performance with media, networks, robotics, locative applications, and mobile systems. Considering theater as an ancient technology of mass participation and social cohesion, this fusion studio explores how emerging technologies can expand upon the basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach. Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience. Expanded Theater is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional theatrical production modes and beyond each students individual discipline. The curriculum combines resources from Carnegie Mellons Schools of Art and Drama, Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe), the Emerging Media Masters (EM2), Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, and their collaborators across the university in a new configuration. Expanded Theater will explore domains ranging from site specific and networked-based performance and interventionist practices, to pervasive social media technologies and their influence on interpersonal communication. The goal is to investigate contemporary languages that allow authors, actors and technologists to collaborate in ways that push beyond our present understanding of theatrical production and reception. This course alternates between two modes of research and design.	Lawrence Shea<>Ali Momeni	2<>4	1500	1620	HL A10A
60-451	Advanced DP3: Concepts of Figuration	10.0	Art	This course encourages creative exploration of the human image beyond observational figure drawing.

60-474	Seduction and Sedition	10.0	Art	Dont Wait For the Draft or perpetuate militainment, global apartheid, market shock doctrine or internet stagnation through acquiescence.  We will analyze propaganda, literally that which is to be spread, from many sources and create our own in this blended seminar/studio course.  In considering alternative tactics of communication and dissemination through encounters with internationally renowned historians, reporters, artists and activists, we will create arts of independence and media pragmatism, working in small cross-disciplinary teams.  Heightened public interest during the fall presidential elections will enhance co-production and urgency.    As in any economic model we will take scarce resources (accurate information), turn them into commodities (artwork or aesthetic experience) and distribute these (through a variety of vehicles) to consumers (audience, participants).   Course Objectives   In successfully completing this course, students should be able to: * concentrate wealth into fewer and fewer hands * develop a bottom-line profit orientation * over rely on government and corporate sources of news * avoid offending the powerful * worship religiously the market economy and oppose alternate beliefs   (seriously) Learning Outcomes In successfully completing this course, students will: * gain knowledge in and connect social activism, international relations, public policy, communication, tactical media, realpolitik, the digital * spectacular or the cultural imaginary in relation to the arts * work collaboratively through intense multiple-pronged projects of public address * identify, research, and articulate urgent issues verbally and in writing * create visual, aural, temporal or performative critical art and discuss that of others	Andrew Johnson	2<>4	1830	2120	CFA 308

62-326	Photographic Narrative	9.0	CFA Interdisciplinary	Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives.  In this course, students will make two series of photographs: one that is fiction and one that is non-fiction. In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who constructed private worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Charlesworth, and Laurie Simmons. As students explore both fiction and non-fiction through photographs, we will look at the interesting interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create tempos; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives.  Prerequisite: a college level photography course or consent of instructor.	Charlee Brodsky	5	0830	1120	MM 121

62-736	Special Topic: International Perspectives in Arts Management	3.0	CFA Interdisciplinary	Course will meet on April 3 (9 am-12 pm), April 4 (9 am-3pm) and April 10 (9 am-12pm).    Internationalization processes and globalization are general phenomena, increasingly booming in the last decades as rarely before. The arts sector (however defined) is not an exception: in terms of both demand and supply, no matter the specific arts discipline, there are clear tendencies towards the creation of a ?global? market. Here however ? more than in other contexts ? important local characteristics tend to ?resist? the process of homologation within a single global (undifferentiated) ?market?. Identity processes are often involved; different administrative trajectories also play a central role, in particular related to radical different roles played by the State and different government levels.  The course is organized around three main ideas. First, understanding the rhetorical nature of management (in general and in the particular case of art management) is an indispensable prerequisite to understand the social construction base of management discourse, and it possible variations. Second, there is the need to take seriously into account the implications emerging from organizational theory and strategic change literature in the context of the art sector, from bounded rationality to the dynamics of change. Third, there is a need to learn to deal with public sector changes in the variety of administrative context across different countries and different administrative traditions.  Case studies such as The British Museum, Ferrara Buskers Festival, Bologna Archeological Museum, Heritage Malta and others will provide contextual framework for understanding of these unique perspectives in international arts management and cultural heritage.

64-420	The Crucible of Modernity:Vienna 1900	9.0	Center for the Arts in Society	Vienna at the turn of the century (that is, at the turn of the last century, 1900) was many things: the political center of the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the meeting place of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians, Slavs, Poles, Italians, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Germans; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism and of psychoanalysis; the battleground for liberalism and anti-Semitism; a haven for socialism; the home of caf-culture and the waltz; the garrison for an outdated army; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; the center for Enlightenment public policy and reactionary bureaucracy; and the showcase for historicism. And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings - and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.

65-201	Humanities Scholars III	9.0	General Dietrich College	65-201, Fall 2016: Poetry and Power. Frederick Douglass argued, Poets, prophets, and reformers are all picture-makers, and this ability is the secret of their power and achievements: they see what ought to be by the reflection of what is, and endeavor to remove the contradiction. Poetry is often perceived as an elite art, practiced within the confines of academia and understood only by a chosen few. But poetry is historically grounded in an oral tradition and a sense of public ownership. Does poetry have power in our society? What is its social function? How is poetry distinct from other modes of writing? Can poetry advance social movements and connect people with perspectives beyond their usual comfort zones? This course will consider arguments about poetry and its relationship with society. We will engage our questions via different disciplinary viewpoints, and across time and cultures. Students will read and discuss poetry both on and off the page, as well as explore arguments about poetry, poetics, and power via essays, literature, performance, media, and community engagement.

69-129	Rape Agression Defense Systems (RAD)	3.0	Physical Education	Self Defense for Women - is a course specifically designed to increase womens awareness of potential sexual assault and to provide physical techniques to respond to such an act.  It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class (other than instructors or other authorized persons) can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of like-minded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System (R.A.D.)which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto:  To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.  This course is composed of three sections:  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal self-awareness  the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs  holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional  physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors (padded/protected) as attackers, and students (padded/protected) responding to the assault.

70-341	Organizational Communication	9.0	Business Administration	Much of the work in groups and organizations consists of communication.  You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work.  The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them.

Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures.  Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks.  Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what youve learned.	Robert Kraut	2<>4	0900	1020	SH 208

70-395	Funding Entrepreneurial Ventures	9.0	Business Administration	So you want to do a startup and you know that you need funding. There are multiple ways to fund a new venture: bootstrapping, economic development, angels, venture capitalists. The question is what are these funders looking for in an early stage investment? What is important to them? How do they decide which companies to invest in and which not? This class looks at funding from the funders point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria, sourcing, selection, due diligence, deal structure, valuation, post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected, as investment teams, to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not).   This is a highly interactive and project class. There will be multiple guest speakers.   Prerequisites: Students are highly encouraged to take any of the introductory entrepreneurship classes offered in various schools and departments. While no financial background is required, this class will not cover the basics of entrepreneurship from the entrepreneurs perspective, but will be looking from the investor point of view.

CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS: 1) Cold-calling: I follow an active learning approach requiring high introspection/ reflection/ learning via readings/ preparations before classes, and high interaction during class where students share their insights. This flipped classroom requires that you learn the material I post before coming to class. In class, I like to focus on applying skills as much as possible. It also implies that I will cold call students as integral part of our classroom experience. If you hate cold calling and presenting your homework solutions in front of class, this class is not for you. 2) Final exam: This class has proctored midterm and final exams that are comprehensive and by design difficult. But class grades are soft-curved, i.e. overall class participation and class performance across years determines cut-off percentages. One of the homeworks for this class is solving the final exam from a prior year. If you hate challenging exams that require you to combine all aspects learned in class, this class is not for you. 3) The class cannot be audited nor taken pass/fail.

70-482	Pricing Strategy	9.0	Business Administration	Pricing is a critical marketing decision which enables a firm to translate customer value into profit. This course provides a first survey of pricing concepts. Instead of discussing pricing in isolation, we focus on the interplay between pricing and other aspects of marketing, such as positioning, branding and advertising. To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful.

73-328	Health Economics	12.0	Economics	This course will teach the student to use economic analysis to understand critical issues in health care and and health policy. We will address issues such as the following:   1. What factors best explain the level and rate of growth of U.S. health expenditures?   2. Does the recent high rate of growth of U.S. health care expenditures make U.S. firms less competitive in international markets?   3. What are some of the likely consequences (intended and unintended) of the proposed reforms to Medicare?   4. Can physicians induce demand for their services?   5. What are the impacts of managed care on the health care system?   6. Do strong affiliations between physicians and health plans hurt competition?    (Lecture, 3 hours).

73-449	Social, Economic and Information Networks	9.0	Economics	Interaction is a fundamental part of social science: firms market products to consumers, people share opinions and information with their friends, workers collaborate on projects, agents form alliances and coalitions. In this course, we will use the emerging field of social networks to put structure on this diverse mass of connections. Using a mixture of theoretical, empirical, and computational methods, we will learn about the structure and function of social networks. We will look at how an individuals position in a social network reflects her role in the community. We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions. (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade standard of C applies only to economics courses.

73-469	Global Electronic Markets: Economics and the Internet	9.0	Economics	The information revolution brought about by the Internet is having a dramatic impact on the organization of economic activity. Long-term contractual relationships that once governed corporate procurement are being dismantled as manufacturers use the Internet to market directly to the public. New transportation networks that used to simply move goods from point A to point B are evolving into dynamic inventory pipelines that allow manufacturers to track and even reroute shipments in real time. At the same time, individuals are making use of sophisticated search engines to comparison shop at a scale that would have been physically exhausting even five years ago. In the Economics of E-commerce, we will use the basic tools of economic analysis to understand how and why the changes in information technology are reshaping the economic landscape.  (Lecture, 3 hours). Minimum grade standard of C applies only to economics courses.	Stephen Spear	2<>4	1030	1150	POS MN AUD
73-476	American Economic History	9.0	Economics	The study of economic history provides important perspective on current economic institutions and policies. A failure to understand the historical evolution of economic institutions or the variety of past economic experience is perhaps the worst shortcoming of many economists. The study of economic history provides an opportunity to test currently fashionable theories against data different from those used in their construction. In fact, this is a course in applied economics. The theories developed in the intermediate courses will be applied to episodes from the past in ways that increase understanding both of the specific historical episodes considered and the economic theories employed.

76-100	Reading and Writing in an Academic Context	9.0	English	76-100 is an academic reading and writing course for multilingual students, especially those who are not native speakers of English or who consider English to be their weaker language.  The course, designed as a prerequisite for 76-101, emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.

76-101	Interpretation and Argument	9.0	English	76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

76-101	Interpretation and Argument	9.0	English	76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach.

Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

76-102	Shakespeare: Comedies and Romances	9.0	English	76-102, Advanced First-Year Writing courses are designed for students who have demonstrated an understanding of academic writing that most incoming freshmen have not. Because of the students level of preparedness, the First-Year Writing Program provides intensive, advanced courses for students to work closely with senior faculty within the English department. Advanced courses assume that students have established strong reading and synthesizing skills, as well as a demonstrated interest in writing and communication, prior to entering Carnegie Mellon. The course topics shift each semester. Students enroll through special invitation. Class size for 76102 is capped at 19 and there are no prerequisites for the course.

The class will read a number of books by authors in various genres, and students will have the opportunity to interact with these authors through public readings and classroom visits. In addition, the class will take advantage of other literary events happening around Pittsburgh in order to further engage with places where writing comes off the page and engages with the world. Revision will be required and emphasized.	James Daniels	2<>4	0900	1020	BH 255B
76-221	Books You Should Have Read By Now	9.0	English	This class is for those people who should have read some of the best books around, but havent managed to yet -- books you should have read by now. We will ask ourselves how classics of American literature define America, and what they mean for the American culture we experience now. We will confront the frontier wilderness of James Fenimore Coopers The Last of the Mohicans and consider Henry David Thoreaus challenges to industrial society in Walden. We will explore the racial conflicts of 1920s Harlem in Toni Morrisons Jazz, take part in Jack Kerouacs search for authentic experiences in On The Road, and speculate about what it means to be human after the collapse of civilization in Cormac McCarthys The Road. Along the way, we will use the idea that literature is equipment for living, to help us understand ourselves and others, the past and the present, and the experiences that inform how we view our cultures and our world.

76-239	Introduction to Film Studies	9.0	English	This course will serve as an introduction to the history, theory, and form of film. In the first half of the semester, we will look at the early moments of cinema, tracing the historical development of film form and narrative while investigating the incipient theories that sought to define its methods and effects. Working primarily through Bordwell and Thompsons seminal text, Film Art: An Introduction, we will also learn the grammar of and various approaches to analyzing film. Additionally, we will trace the rise of the Hollywood studio system, understanding and situating its dominance during its golden age by watching movies that both represent and challenge the classical Hollywood mode. In the second half of the course, we will survey several national cinema movements, such as Italian Neorealism and French New Wave. And alongside a wide range of international films, we will consider many of the dominant strains within film theory, e.g., discussing auteur theory and watching an Ingmar Bergman film. To finish class, we will define the place of the big-budget, hybrid-form blockbuster in our increasingly global and interconnected context, interrogating the current state of the movies and moviegoing.

76-241	Introduction to Gender Studies	9.0	English	What is gender? What is sex? And how do we perform these identities in everyday life? Covering topics such as pornography, feminism, bros, queer theory, and transgender rights, this course will introduce you how power and inequality have historically and structurally impacted categories of gender in American society. We will read novels, scholarly texts, and even blogs in an effort to understand how gender intersects with other forms of identity (such as race, class, sexuality, ability, and nationality).   Through a combination of class discussions, written essays, and short presentations, we will ultimately understand gender as a social construct that nonetheless is meaningful, personal, and significant for all members of society.

To that end, students will view short and feature-length films, paying special attention to such fundamentals as character development and story structure. Students will read screenplays to see how scripts provide the blueprints for the final product, and write analytical papers. To gain experience and confidence, students will work on a number of exercises that will lead them toward producing a polished short screenplay by the end of the semester.

76-271	Introduction to Professional and Technical Writing	9.0	English	Introduction to Professional and Technical Writing is designed specifically for declared majors in Professional or Technical Writing. The main work of the course is a series of five situation-based writing assignments spread over three broad and often overlapping areas - business/professional writing, media writing, and technical writing.   Typical assignments include resumes, instructions, proposals, and adaptations of specialized information for non-expert audiences. At least one of the assignments will be a group project. As a final project, you?ll create a portfolio of polished writing samples that you can use in applying for internships and employment.   The range of assignments in the course is designed to give you experience with a variety of writing situations that professional writers frequently encounter. The assignments also reflect options for specialization that you may wish to pursue in future coursework and in your career as a professional writer. As you work through the assignments, you should learn both current conventions for the kinds of writing you?ll be doing and a broadly applicable procedure for analyzing novel situations and adapting conventional forms (and creating new ones) to meet the unique demands of each new situation and task.

Well, which is better? Happinesswhat it means, how to measure it, and how to achieve itis something we often ponder in private, but increasingly it is something we think about publicly, too. The subject comes up as often in international policy debates as it does in dorm rooms. The United Nations now issues reports on global happiness. But what is happiness? How does it differ from place to place, from one time to another? This course will examine happiness as a concept in Russian and Soviet culture, one that was fiercely contested during key moments of radical change, such as the Bolshevik Revolution, Stalinism, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Through a wide range of works by Russian writers (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky), artists (Malevich), and filmmakers (Eisenstein, Tarkovsky), students will become familiar with how different ideas of happiness have shaped Russian life and art, and develop a critical perspective on contemporary discussions of happiness. The course will be conducted entirely in English, and no prior knowledge of Russian or familiarity with Russian culture is required. Students should expect to complete reading assignments, participate in class discussions, and write three short essays. There will also be opportunities for students to interact with members of the Russian-speaking community in Pittsburgh.	Tatyana Gershkovich	2<>4	1530	1650	BH 154A

76-338	The Rise of the Blockbuster Film	9.0	English	This course will focus on the American film industry during the 1970s and into the early 1980s. When Steven Spielbergs Jaws, understood as the first American blockbuster, was released in 1975 it radically changed the global distribution and marketing of film.  Spielbergs film - like many blockbusters after it - was a mix of transgressive cinematic genres, advanced filmmaking techniques, and classical Hollywood narrative and form. While this class is focused on a national cinema our approach to the blockbuster will attend to this mix, which is the product of transnational and transhistorical economic and aesthetic forces. To that end we will screen films from Hollywoods Golden Age, other national cinemas, as well as genres associated with grindhouse and the avant-garde film.	Jeffrey Hinkelman	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 342F
76-343	Rise of the American Novel	9.0	English	This course will survey American fiction from the beginning of the nation through the first half of the twentieth century. We will look at early fiction, like Washington Irvings Rip Van Winkle and mid-1800s classics like Hawthornes Scarlet Letter, up to twentieth-century works like The Great Gatsby and perhaps some contemporary novels.   Through the term, we will ask how the fiction represents the special character of American experience. Alongside readings, you will write several short papers and present some of your research to the class.	Jeffrey Williams	2	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-344	Censored Texts	9.0	English	Censorship? Banned books? Book burnings? Could it happen here? Over the last century some of the most important films and books have book banned, censored, protested and withdrawn from high schools and in rare cases, college courses or public libraries. But artists dont like to be silenced, and many of them have found ways to tell their stories, regardless of the consequences. In this course we will read a handful of books that have all been challenged by parents, school boards, and/or library patrons. This year is a special Sci-Fi/Fantasy version of the course We will read texts including Shirley Jacksons The Lottery and Other Stories, J.D. Madeleine LEngle A Wrinkle in Time, J.K Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Salman Rushdies Satanic Verses, Margaret Atwoods The Handmaidens Tale, Octavia Butlers Kindred, and Chuck Palahniuks, Fight Club.

The class will give you a sense of the concepts and concerns critics have used to talk not only about literature but about culture and society.	Jeffrey Williams	2<>4	1500	1620	WEH 8427
76-359	Planning and Testing Documents	9.0	English	In this course, you will deepen your mastery of the following research skills associated with planning and testing documents: interviewing in context, retrospective interviewing, focus groups, surveys, and testing documents. In addition to specific research methods and skills, we will cover issues that pertain to all research methods: How many people do I need to include in my study? How should I select them? Are my results valid? Is what I think Im finding out reliable? What are the ethical issues in my study? We will use a combination of lecture, discussion, exercises and projects to achieve these objectives.  This course will be useful for any student who is interested in learning more about methods that are widely used in professions such as designing/writing for new media, technical writing, science and healthcare communication, public  media relations, policy and non-profit communication.	Christine Neuwirth	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 336A
76-364	American Novels	9.0	English	Writers have always turned to their predecessors for inspiration and in this class we will do that. We will read and discuss several novels, some short stories, and look at some film and television narratives, though our primary focus will be on the novels.    Using these works as master texts, we will examine some essential questions about the art of fiction, including (but not excluding other critical analysis) how a novel is structured, what determines character, how the point of view informs the narrative, how voice is established; well look at the different ways narratives develop, well consider how stories conclude, and well discuss why and how fiction moves us.   You do not have to be a writer to take the course but the focus of our readings and discussions will be on the writers craft.       Reading List might include:  The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway, Sound and Fury, William Faulkner, Franny and Zooey, J.D. Salinger, Beloved, Toni Morrison, The Secret History, Donna Tartt, A Tale for the Time Being, Ruth Ozeki, The Space Between Us, Thrity Umrigar, Break it Down, Lydia Davis.

76-365	Beginning Poetry Workshop	9.0	English	In this course students will read and discuss the work of contemporary poets, attend outside readings, critique classmates? poems, and write a significant number of their own poems. We will explore elements of craft through reading published work as well as completing in-class and take-home writing assignments. Though we will mostly be reading, writing, and discussing individual poems, toward the end of the semester we will move on to discussing (and writing) the poetic series.	James Daniels	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 226B
76-368	Role Playing Game Writing Workshop	12.0	English	Role playing games - mainly traditional pencil-and-paper, but recently, video game RPGs as well - have matured over the last 40 years into a viable medium for modern interactive storytelling. There is now a generation of novelists, screenwriters, playwrights and TV writers who first honed their story-telling chops when they were a Gamesmaster of a Role Playing Game (RPG). The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games.  The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic.  The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting. It should be emphasized this is a writing course, not an RPG design course.	Gerard Klug	2<>4	1030	2420	HL 106B

76-372	News Writing	9.0	English	In this introductory class, taught by a working journalist, students will learn the fundamental skills of reporting, writing and copy editing. Well start with the basics - judging newsworthiness, conducting research and interviews, then organizing the information into a concise, clear, accurate and interesting news story. Because the key to learning to write effectively is to practice the necessary skills, class emphasis - and much of your grade - will be based on seven writing assignments involving current events and covering various types of news writing. Through readings, assignments and class discussion, well tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story? Well do a lot of writing, but well also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today. Well cover at least two live events and hear from local professionals about working in print, broadcast and public relations. Well also look at how newer mediums - such as blogs, the internet, and cable news - shape and influence news reporting.	Steven Twedt	4	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-373	Argument	9.0	English	This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of argument. The course begins with an overview of major theories of argument followed by consideration of a variety of topics in argument production, analysis, and evaluation, often applying the principles we study to specific cases in class. Students will each select a type or genre of argument-whether academic, practical, professional, or otherwise-upon which to focus their research throughout the course. Students will begin by developing short assessments of the value and relevance of major theories of argument to the type of argument they are researching, then develop their own approach to argument analysis and apply it to an example of that type of argument, before producing an original argument of the type they have been studying by the end of the course.

76-375	Magazine Writing	9.0	English	In this course, we will read substantial, ambitious articles from a variety of magazines, considering their appeal to wide audiences. Students will write their own magazine articles, working with both their own autobiography and subjects they engage as field researchers. We will also be considering on-line, oral narratives, as a way to expand the concept of what a magazine is, and students will have the opportunity to create narratives for oral presentation. In this course, you should expect to develop your ability to create a good narrative, to gain experience in the field as interviewer and observer of the world, to become a better editor of your own work and the work of others, and to learn about aspects of culture from a wide variety of contemporary magazine writers. The class is run as a discussion with emphasis on student participation.	Jane Mccafferty	1<>3	1200	0120	BH 255B
76-381	Mad-Men, Television, and the History of Advertising	9.0	English	Don Draper, cigarette in one hand, drink in the other, on the prowl for his next conquest - be it client or lover - may be one of the coolest characters ever created for American television. But is it just the suave style of Mad Men that has made it so popular? What is the secret to the shows success? In this class we will explore the rise and fall of the 20th century advertising model of mass culture by watching episodes from seven seasons of Mad Men, analyzing the show, and reading about the history of advertising as well as analyses of the show itself. Texts for the course will include Richard Ohmanns essay Where did Mass Culture Come From?, Michael Schudsons Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion, Archie Bostons Fly In The Buttermilk: Memoirs of an African American in Advertising, Design  Design Education, Susan Faludi: Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, Scott F.

76-384	Race, Nation, and the Enemy	9.0	English	Conflicts over racial and national identity continue to dominate headlines in the United States as they often have during the nations history, from debates regarding the immigration, naturalization, and birthright citizenship of racial minorities to debates regarding racial disparities in access to civil rights. This course explores the discursive practices through which racial and national identities are formed and the frequent conflicts between them, particularly by focusing on the role of enemies, threats to the nation, and sacrifices made on behalf of the nation in American public discourse. Alongside primary sources of public discourse regarding wars, the immigration and citizenship of racial minorities, racial segregation and civil rights, and the criminal prosecutions of dissidents during periods of crisis, we will read secondary sources offering multiple theoretical and disciplinary approaches to the study of racial and national identity formation. Along with regular brief responses to readings, assignments will include a short rhetorical analysis paper and a longer research paper.	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1030	1150	SH 212
76-386	Language & Culture	9.0	English	This course is an introduction into the scholarship surrounding the nature of language and the question of how language shapes and is shaped by social, cultural and political contexts. We will begin by studying important literature in linguistics and language theory, both to introduce us to how scholars think about language and to give us a shared vocabulary to use for the rest of the semester. We will then move into case studies and theoretical works exploring the intersections of language use, individual and group identities, and the exercise of power, in its many forms. In particular, we will focus on the relationship between language and culture by asking, in what ways does language influence and constitute social change? How is social change reflected by changes in the way we use language? Over the course of the semester, you will work on applying the knowledge and theoretical tools you gain to your own analysis of a linguistic artifact that you choose.

76-388	Topics in Digital Humanities: Coding for Humanities	9.0	English	This introductory course provides humanities students with the foundational knowledge and skills to develop computer-aided research tools for text analysis. Through a series of hands-on coding exercises, students will explore computation as a means to engage in new questions and expand their thinking about textual artifacts.  This course is designed for students with no (or very little) coding experience. During the early part of the semester, students will learn basic programming using Python through examples and problem sets that are relevant to text analysis. Then, students will be introduced to a limited set of commonly used Python packages for text analysis, such as natural language processing, statistical analysis, visualization, web scraping, and social media text mining.   Students are expected to complete a small final project that examines how evidence-based data-driven insights derived from text analysis would support humanistic research in their area of interest, including (but not limited to) genre studies, rhetorical criticism, authorship attribution, discourse analysis, cultural analysis, social network analysis, spatial/temporal text analysis, and writing assessment. Doctoral students in the Department of English must register for 12 units, and are expected to write a publishable quality paper.  Students who are interested in digital humanities scholarship in literary and cultural studies may also consider Professor Warrens seminar: 76429/829 Introduction to Digital Humanities.

76-389	Rhetorical Grammar	9.0	English	The primary objective of this course is to provide professional writers with a framework for identifying and authoritatively discussing the grammatical forms and constructions they will be using. The course also includes some linguistic analysis, a consideration of English orthography, and discussion of the notions of standards and correctness in language. The concern throughout is to develop an understanding of those elements of grammar and usage that are the foundation for good professional writing and for leadership in professional writing settings.

76-390	Style	9.0	English	In classical rhetoric, style is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write ? coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance ? can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved ?good? style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?	Daniel Dickson-Laprade	1<>3	0900	1020	BH 255B

This course provides students who have already learned the foundation of written communication with an opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create visual-verbal synergy in printed documents. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary, as well as the practical issues of visual communication design through a series of hands-on projects in various rhetorical situations. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are an essential part of this course.  Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be taught in class, and used to create the assigned projects.

76-396	Genres, Methods, and Issues	9.0	English	Given the changes brought on by the information age, non-profit organizations, like all organizations, face an increasing diversity of audiences and media choices. What hasnt changed is the need for effective arguments (print and digital) that respond to both the rhetorical situations at hand and the ongoing needs of a specific organization. In this course, designed for students pursuing careers in professional communication, well examine the critically important practices of argument and advocacy. And while our central focus will be on non-profits, the arts, education, political advocacy and social causes, the techniques well learn are also broadly applicable to communications careers in all sectors. Our main focus will be on how professional communicators design arguments and make media choices consistent with the voice of their organizations. Among other questions, we will ask, how can we adapt the genres of mass communication to meet our organizations goals? What roles can social media play in non-profit advocacy, and how are those roles changing? How can we have impact while working with limited budgets? The end result will be a professional portfolio that demonstrates both relevant skills and a high-level theoretical understanding of what makes a public argument successful. Students will also gain experience in translating their technical expertise into language that potential employers understand and look for.	Korryn Mozisek	1<>3	0900	1020	SH 219

Together, these groups will then curate a show with stories and objects that reflect the culture and history of Pittsburgh.     This course is designed for students who love stories and have the curiosity and motivation to travel throughout Pittsburgh to find them.	Jane Bernstein	2<>4	1330	1450	BH A54
76-403	The Crucible of Modernity:Vienna 1900	9.0	English	Vienna at the turn of the century (that is, at the turn of the last century, 1900) was many things: the political center of the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the meeting place of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians, Slavs, Poles, Italians, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Germans; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism and of psychoanalysis; the battleground for liberalism and anti-Semitism; a haven for socialism; the home of caf-culture and the waltz; the garrison for an outdated army; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; the center for Enlightenment public policy and reactionary bureaucracy; and the showcase for historicism. And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings - and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.

76-410	The Long Eighteenth Century	None	English	This course offers students a chance to understand how English literature became modern.  We will explore the cultural and historical processes by which we get from Shakespeare to Austen by looking at the historical development of two media forms, the stage play and the novel.  Since this archive includes an impossible amount of material to cover in a semesters work, we will focus on some points of connection and synergy between these forms.  For example, we will read a novel and a play by Aphra Behn, a poet, playwright, spy and one of the inventors of the modern novel.  Eliza Haywood was both an actress and a prolific and successful novelist of the early 18th century.  One of the fathers of the modern novel, Henry Fielding, cut his literary teeth writing plays for the Haymarket Theatre, which he also managed (and Haywood acted in).  Frances Burney wrote a wildly successful novel, Evelina or a Young Ladys Entrance into the World, but she also wrote plays and was part of London literary circles that included famous actors, musicians, and other performers for the stage.  We will end with Austens novel, Mansfield Park, which stages on its pages an amateur production of a play in order to reflect the pleasures and dangers of theatricality.  We will look at the interplay between theater and print fiction and how they mutually inform and help to define each other.  We will ask how public theatrical institutions and performances and the technology of print contributed to the modern world of proliferating media forms.	Kristina Straub	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 145C
76-415	Mediated Power and Propaganda	9.0	English	For most of us, the word propaganda triggers a familiar script. We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies. Finally, we will consider how to analyze propaganda, generating methodological prerequisites for scholarly study. Ultimately, students will have the opportunity to conduct their own research on propaganda as it relates to their academic and professional goals.	John Oddo	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A19
76-419	Media in a Digital Age	9.0	English	How are media in a digital age changing? And how are they changing us? What does it mean to be living in today?s communication technology revolution? In a time when many forms of communication are digitally based, traveling as bits at e-speeds on global computer networks? To begin answering these questions, we will take as case studies several new discursive digital media formations, such as digital books, on-line newspapers, blogs, wikis, and so forth, along with related social formations, such as social media and distributed non-profit activist organizations. The readings will provide a range of lens by which to understand these developments, including cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects. We will briefly put the development of communication technologies in their historical context: How were new forms of communication received in the past? How were they used? How did they affect communication? How did they influence political and social institutions? We will focus, however, on using knowledge of historical developments to inform our understandings of current digital communication developments.  Along the way we will ask questions, such as What are some of the challenges that new digital formations present to traditional communication theories (e.g., What does authorship look like in massively open online collaborations when the boundaries between reading and authoring are blurred? How is trust established when speakers are anonymous and globally distributed? How are identities discursively constructed? How is the public sphere constituted when Internet search engines dynamically construct it?).	Christine Neuwirth	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 255B
76-421	Why Stories Matter	9.0	English	Storytelling is a key aspect of our experience as human beings; without it we are reduced to, as one scholar put it, the most primitive mode of existence - a life without imaginary alternatives. In this course we will study some key fictions that have provided such imaginary alternatives, alongside various theories for interpreting them. These narratives deal with some of the most important aspects of the human condition: time, justice, empathy, point of view, and reality. The authors we will cover are among the most enduring in the Western tradition, from Sophocles and Chaucer to Melville, Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Ian McEwan. Students will be required to contribute to all class meetings, write brief responses on Blackboard, and produce two substantial essays (longer for grads than undergrads).	Andreea Ritivoi<>Peggy Knapp	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 255B
76-429	Introduction to Digital Humanities	9.0	English	This course introduces students to core methods and readings in Digital Humanities, an emerging field thats been called the next big thing in literary and cultural studies. Students will read influential scholarship by Robert Binkley, Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, Peter deBolla, Johanna Drucker, Alan Liu, Jerome McGann, and Bethany Nowviskie and explore successful projects like Linked Jazz, Histography, Wearing Gay History, Colored Conventions, Transcribe Bentham, NYPL Building Inspector, and Six Degrees of Francis Bacon. Graded assignments in the course will include a class presentation (focusing on a single issue of a digital humanities journal), a project proposal, and a final paper or projectcollaborative if desiredon a research question of students choice.   In an effort to facilitate non-traditional collaborations, the course is open to (a.) humanities students curious about computational approaches to humanistic questions and (b.) students with technical, data-driven, or design backgrounds interested in contributing to humanistic knowledge.   Students interested in gaining experience with specific digital humanities tools are encouraged to enroll as well in Prof. Ishizakis concurrent Topics in Digital Humanities: Coding for Humanities (76-388/788), a nice complement to this course.

76-439	Stars and Celebrities	9.0	English	In the late 1700s moral crusaders were worried about the latest media scandal: the surge in women reading novels. As one observer complained, Women, of every age, of every condition....retain a taste for novels. I find [novels]...in the work-bag of the seamstress, in the hands of the lady who lounges on the sofa, the mistresses of nobles, the mistresses of snuff-shops, the belles who read them in town, and the chits who spell them in the country. While today we might be genuinely concerned about texting while driving, or the depression associated with high levels of facebook use, in this class we wont judge so much as we will analyze. We will look at what historical media trends have in common with, and how they are different from, the media trends of today. We will read about the print revolution, the electronic media revolution, the current digital revolution, and we will also try to peer into the future. Importantly, we will take a literary and cultural studies approach to this material. We will ask, specifically, what can the humanities teach us about media revolutions over time? How is narrative, or story telling, central to each media revolution? Texts for the class will include: Super Sad True Love Story, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, Spreadable Media: Creating Value and Meaning in a Networked Culture, and Black Code: Inside the Battle For Cyberspace.	David Shumway	2	1830	2120	BH 145C
76-444	History of Books and Reading: Media before "New Media"	9.0	English	Rather than putting an end to the book, digital media have had the oddly exhilarating effect of making us look at all kinds of print, past and present, through newly focused lenses.  This course will introduce you to the history of books and reading, a cross-fertilizing field of study that is having an impact on many disciplines, from the history of science to literary history, cultural studies, and the arts.  We will read scholarship in this still-emerging field to orient you to its key issues, practical and methodological problems, and theoretical implications: work by Roger Chartier, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau, Adrian Johns, and others. Well also read primary texts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries --including Joseph Addison, Jane Austen, Samuel Coleridge, Charles Dickens and others--to see how differing modes of print and reading were keenly contested cultural and political matters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Other topics include the division between new reading publics and their ways of reading books; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press). We will study the relation between the aesthetic powers of the text and the material pleasures of the book; the emergence of a modern, imaginative category of literature in conjunction with the consolidating power of the novel. Such knowledge of the history of print has become especially crucial in an era of emerging new media and the field of digital humanities in the university.	Jon Klancher	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 145C
76-460	Beginning Fiction Workshop	9.0	English	This course builds upon survey or introduction courses to exercise the writers craft in fiction. Several texts will be analyzed, in both the short story and novel forms. We will read closely with a focus on the craft of writing?the voice, point of view, character development, etc. We will develop a vocabulary for speaking about the craft of fiction and hone our skills by reading good fiction, discussing work in class and writing response papers with an eye toward the various aspects of the writing process. We will arrange a schedule in which each student?s work will be reviewed twice via peer review and in-class discussion.	Jane Mccafferty	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 237B
76-462	Advanced Fiction Workshop	9.0	English	In this class we will work on how narratives are told. Using masterworks to help guide our writing, we will spend the first part of the semester writing stories that imitate the style or narrative voice of several authors.   You will have a story due every week.  We will workshop several of these stories concentrating our editorial comments on story, development, character, and voice.  Your time after mid-semester will be devoted to rewriting and reworking these exercises into stories.	Kevin Gonzalez	3	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-465	Advanced Poetry Workshop	9.0	English	Spring 2016: In this course students will read and discuss the collections of contemporary poets, attend outside readings, write and critique their classmates poems, and assist in a collaborative mentoring project with the literary arts students at the Pittsburgh High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA). In addition to focusing on the writing and critique of individual poems, we will examine concepts such as the poetic series, hybrid forms, and the art of translation. This class assumes an understanding of poetic terminology and workshop protocol and requires a high degree of self-motivation.	Lauren Shapiro	2<>4	1330	1450	GHC 5222
76-476	Rhetoric of Science	9.0	English	This course broadly explores questions about scientific argument and communication that are of interest to scientists, rhetoric of science scholars, and professional/technical writing practitioners. These include questions like: How are scientific arguments structured? How is scientific information and argument transformed when it moves from research papers to publications for non-specialist audiences? How does the social, historical, and cultural context of science shape the way it is communicated and/or argued?  In what ways might stylistic features of language and thought influence the invention and communication of scientific ideas? What contributions do visuals make to scientific argument and communication?	James Wynn	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A22
76-481	Introduction to Multimedia Design	12.0	English	There is increasing demand for professional/technical writers who understand multimedia and its communicative possibilities. This class will provide students with the opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create multimedia experiences that merge text, spoken voice, music, animation and video. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary of multimedia, as well as the practical issues surrounding multimedia design through a series of hands-on projects involving various contexts. Students will explore what it means to write for a dynamic medium and how to take advantage of elements of time, motion and sound to help writers expand their communicative skills. Class discussion and critiques are an essential part of this course.  Students will be taught to work with a variety of available cameras, recorders and other production equipment to create the elements of their projects. While students are not expected to become masters of multimedia software, the essentials of Adobe After Effects, Premiere and Audition will be taught in order to provide the basic skills necessary to complete assignments and explore multimedia possibilities.	Brian Staszel	1<>3<>5	1200	0120	CFA 318
76-700	Professional Seminar	3.0	English	This weekly, 3-unit seminar is designed to give professional writing majors an overview of possible career and internship options and ways to pursue their professional interests. Each session will feature guest presenters who are professionals working in diverse communications-related fields such as web design, journalism, public relations, corporate and media relations, technical writing, medical communications, and working for non-profits. The visiting professionals talk about their own and related careers, show samples of their work, and answer student questions. The course is required for first-year MAPW students and open to all English undergraduates, who are urged to participate in their sophomore or junior years to explore options for internships and careers.	Necia Werner	5	1030	1150	BH A53
76-702	Global Communication Center Tutoring Practicum	None	English	This practicum prepares students to tutor and conduct research in a communication center serving a range of disciplines.  Students will be exposed to a variety of tutoring methods and gain experience analyzing and responding to academic genres from a range of disciplines.  In addition, we will learn to support oral, visual, and collaborative modes of communication alongside more traditional written genres.  All students in the practicum will be expected to design and complete a research project on an unfamiliar academic genre, tutoring methods, or online delivery of tutoring.   Students should also expect to receive extensive feedback from faculty and peers on their tutoring methods.  Texts will consist of a variety of readings on tutoring, responding to student writing, academic literacy, and communication across the disciplines.

76-706	Editing and Publishing	None	English	In this course students will work closely with the editors of Carnegie Mellon University Press to learn many of the facets of producing books. These range from business management and marketing to the elements of editing, book design, and production.	Gerald Costanzo	NA	NA	NA	NA
76-707	Independent Study in Professional Writing	None	English	An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number  length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabus/schedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings.	Thomas Werner	NA	NA	NA	NA

76-720	Organizational Communication	None	English	Communications are the essence of an organization. Members of an organization who are proficient in various modes of communications and who appreciate the influences of both formal organizational structures and informal social networks generally excel, while those less skilled frequently derail. To help students navigate organizations effectively, this course blends theory and practice in exploring the field of organizational communication. Specific topics include: structures and cultures of organizations; identity and branding; communicating organizational change; communicating to influence and lead; communicating within teams and networks; communication technology; and communication requirements related to performance management, conflict resolution, and globalization.  After completing the course you should be able to: describe social and cultural influences on organizational communication, discuss current and emerging issues in organizational communication, identify ways to manage organizational identity and lead effective change, analyze team and network dynamics, and understand and practice key genres of organizational communication.	Thomas Hajduk	1<>3	1030	1150	PH 226A
76-723	God: A Literary and Cultural History	None	English	This course will investigate ideas about God, primarily from the Western intellectual tradition. Our readings will include selections from Hebrew and Christian scripture, Dantes Inferno, Augustines Confessions, Benedict Spinozas Theological-Political Treatise, and Carl Schmitts Political Theology, as well as more recent investigations by Pope Francis, Marilynne Robinson, and Talal Asad. Students will be responsible for a presentation and two interpretive papers.	Christopher Warren	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 145C
76-738	The Rise of the Blockbuster Film	12.0	English	This course will focus on the American film industry during the 1970s and into the early 1980s. When Steven Spielbergs Jaws, understood as the first American blockbuster, was released in 1975 it radically changed the global distribution and marketing of film. Spielbergs film - like many blockbusters after it - was a mix of transgressive cinematic genres, advanced filmmaking techniques, and classical Hollywood narrative and form. While this class is focused on a national cinema our approach to the blockbuster will attend to this mix, which is the product of transnational and transhistorical economic and aesthetic forces. To that end we will screen films from Hollywoods Golden Age, other national cinemas, as well as genres associated with grindhouse and the avant-garde film.	Jeffrey Hinkelman	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 342F
76-743	Rise of the American Novel	None	English	This course will survey American fiction from the beginning of the nation through the first half of the twentieth century. We will look at early fiction, like Washington Irvings Rip Van Winkle and mid-1800s classics like Hawthornes Scarlet Letter, up to twentieth-century works like The Great Gatsby and perhaps some contemporary novels. Through the term, we will ask how the fiction represents the special character of American experience. Alongside readings, you will write several short papers and present some of your research to the class.	Jeffrey Williams	2	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-750	Theory from Classics to Contemporary	None	English	In this class, we will survey classic literary theories from Platos exiling the poets from his ideal republic, through the philosopher Immanuel Kants reflections on beauty, up to contemporary theories of deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, sexuality, and labor. (Our primary text will be The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism.) The class will give you a sense of the concepts and concerns critics have used to talk not only about literature but about culture and society.	Jeffrey Williams	2<>4	1500	1620	WEH 8427
76-759	Planning and Testing Documents	9.0	English	In this course, you will deepen your mastery of the following research skills associated with planning and testing documents: interviewing in context, retrospective interviewing, focus groups, surveys, and testing documents. In addition to specific research methods and skills, we will cover issues that pertain to all research methods: How many people do I need to include in my study? How should I select them? Are my results valid? Is what I think Im finding out reliable? What are the ethical issues in my study? We will use a combination of lecture, discussion, exercises and projects to achieve these objectives.  This course will be useful for any student who is interested in learning more about methods that are widely used in professions such as designing/writing for new media, technical writing, science and healthcare communication, public  media relations, policy and non-profit communication.	Christine Neuwirth	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 336A
76-772	News Writing	9.0	English	In this introductory class, taught by a working journalist, students will learn the fundamental skills of reporting, writing and copy editing. Well start with the basics - judging newsworthiness, conducting research and interviews, then organizing the information into a concise, clear, accurate and interesting news story. Because the key to learning to write effectively is to practice the necessary skills, class emphasis - and much of your grade - will be based on seven writing assignments involving current events and covering various types of news writing. Through readings, assignments and class discussion, well tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story?  Well do a lot of writing, but well also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today. Well cover at least two live events and hear from local professionals about working in print, broadcast and public relations. Well also look at how newer mediums - such as blogs, the internet, and cable news shape and influence news reporting.	Steven Twedt	4	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-773	Argument	None	English	This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of argument. The course begins with an overview of major theories of argument followed by consideration of a variety of topics in argument production, analysis, and evaluation, often applying the principles we study to specific cases in class. Students will each select a type or genre of argument-whether academic, practical, professional, or otherwise-upon which to focus their research throughout the course. Students will begin by developing short assessments of the value and relevance of major theories of argument to the type of argument they are researching, then develop their own approach to argument analysis and apply it to an example of that type of argument, before producing an original argument of the type they have been studying by the end of the course.	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 235B
76-775	Magazine Writing	9.0	English	In this course, we will read substantial, ambitious articles from a variety of magazines, considering their appeal to wide audiences. Students will write their own magazine articles, working with both their own autobiography and subjects they engage as field researchers. We will also be considering on-line, oral narratives, as a way to expand the concept of what a magazine is, and students will have the opportunity to create narratives for oral presentation. In this course, you should expect to develop your ability to create a good narrative, to gain experience in the field as interviewer and observer of the world, to become a better editor of your own work and the work of others, and to learn about aspects of culture from a wide variety of contemporary magazine writers. The class is run as a discussion with emphasis on student participation.	Jane Mccafferty	1<>3	1200	0120	BH 255B
76-784	Race, Nation, and the Enemy	None	English	Conflicts over racial and national identity continue to dominate headlines in the United States as they often have during the nations history, from debates regarding the immigration, naturalization, and birthright citizenship of racial minorities to debates regarding racial disparities in access to civil rights. This course explores the discursive practices through which racial and national identities are formed and the frequent conflicts between them, particularly by focusing on the role of enemies, threats to the nation, and sacrifices made on behalf of the nation in American public discourse. Alongside primary sources of public discourse regarding wars, the immigration and citizenship of racial minorities, racial segregation and civil rights, and the criminal prosecutions of dissidents during periods of crisis, we will read secondary sources offering multiple theoretical and disciplinary approaches to the study of racial and national identity formation. Along with regular brief responses to readings, assignments will include a short rhetorical analysis paper and a longer research paper.	Douglas Coulson	1<>3	1030	1150	SH 212
76-786	Language and Culture	None	English	This course is an introduction into the scholarship surrounding the nature of language and the question of how language shapes and is shaped by social, cultural and political contexts. We will begin by studying important literature in linguistics and language theory, both to introduce us to how scholars think about language and to give us a shared vocabulary to use for the rest of the semester. We will then move into case studies and theoretical works exploring the intersections of language use, individual and group identities, and the exercise of power, in its many forms. In particular, we will focus on the relationship between language and culture by asking, in what ways does language influence and constitute social change? How is social change reflected by changes in the way we use language? Over the course of the semester, you will work on applying the knowledge and theoretical tools you gain to your own analysis of a linguistic artifact that you choose.	Amanda Berardi	1<>3	1200	0120	BH 145C
76-788	Topics in Digital Humanities: Coding for Humanities	None	English	This introductory course provides humanities students with the foundational knowledge and skills to develop computer-aided research tools for text analysis. Through a series of hands-on coding exercises, students will explore computation as a means to engage in new questions and expand their thinking about textual artifacts.  This course is designed for students with no (or very little) coding experience. During the early part of the semester, students will learn basic programming using Python through examples and problem sets that are relevant to text analysis. Then, students will be introduced to a limited set of commonly used Python packages for text analysis, such as natural language processing, statistical analysis, visualization, web scraping, and social media text mining.   Students are expected to complete a small final project that examines how evidence-based data-driven insights derived from text analysis would support humanistic research in their area of interest, including (but not limited to) genre studies, rhetorical criticism, authorship attribution, discourse analysis, cultural analysis, social network analysis, spatial/temporal text analysis, and writing assessment. Doctoral students in the Department of English must register for 12 units, and are expected to write a publishable quality paper.   Students who are interested in digital humanities scholarship in literary and cultural studies may also consider Professor Warrens seminar: 76429/829 Introduction to Digital Humanities.

76-789	Rhetorical Grammar	9.0	English	This is a course in the grammar that characterizes relatively formal, relatively planned, written English.  As we develop and/or review a vocabulary for talking about the structural choices that are available to writers of English, we will practice analyzing and constructing sentences and parts of sentences.   The course is meant for people whose professional plans include writing or editing.	David Kaufer	1<>3	1200	0120	HL 106C
76-790	Style	9.0	English	In classical rhetoric, style is a term that refers not to what we write but how we write. Yet considerations about how we write - coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance - can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising your own writing and the writing of others.  Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?	John Oddo	2<>4	1030	1150	PH A19A
76-791	Document & Information Design	12.0	English	Today, many professionals are responsible for the visual design of documents. This course provides students who have already learned the foundation of written communication with an opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create visual-verbal synergy in printed documents. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary, as well as the practical issues of visual communication design through a series of hands-on projects in various rhetorical situations. Assigned readings will complement the projects in exploring document design from historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. Class discussions and critiquing are an essential part of this course.  Adobe Creative Studio (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) will be taught in class, and used to create the assigned projects.	Kerry Ishizaki	2<>4<>5	1200	0120	CYH 100A
76-796	Genres, Methods, and Issues	9.0	English	Given the changes brought on by the information age, non-profit organizations, like all organizations, face an increasing diversity of audiences and media choices. What hasnt changed is the need for effective arguments (print and digital) that respond to both the rhetorical situations at hand and the ongoing needs of a specific organization. In this course, designed for students pursuing careers in professional communication, well examine the critically important practices of argument and advocacy. And while our central focus will be on non-profits, the arts, education, political advocacy and social causes, the techniques well learn are also broadly applicable to communications careers in all sectors. Our main focus will be on how professional communicators design arguments and make media choices consistent with the voice of their organizations. Among other questions, we will ask, how can we adapt the genres of mass communication to meet our organizations goals? What roles can social media play in non-profit advocacy, and how are those roles changing? How can we have impact while working with limited budgets? The end result will be a professional portfolio that demonstrates both relevant skills and a high-level theoretical understanding of what makes a public argument successful. Students will also gain experience in translating their technical expertise into language that potential employers understand and look for.	Korryn Mozisek	1<>3	0900	1020	SH 219

76-810	The Long Eighteenth Century	None	English	This course offers students a chance to understand how English literature became modern.  We will explore the cultural and historical processes by which we get from Shakespeare to Austen by looking at the historical development of two media forms, the stage play and the novel.  Since this archive includes an impossible amount of material to cover in a semesters work, we will focus on some points of connection and synergy between these forms.  For example, we will read a novel and a play by Aphra Behn, a poet, playwright, spy and one of the inventors of the modern novel.  Eliza Haywood was both an actress and a prolific and successful novelist of the early 18th century.  One of the fathers of the modern novel, Henry Fielding, cut his literary teeth writing plays for the Haymarket Theatre, which he also managed (and Haywood acted in).  Frances Burney wrote a wildly successful novel, Evelina or a Young Ladys Entrance into the World, but she also wrote plays and was part of London literary circles that included famous actors, musicians, and other performers for the stage.  We will end with Austens novel, Mansfield Park, which stages on its pages an amateur production of a play in order to reflect the pleasures and dangers of theatricality.  We will look at the interplay between theater and print fiction and how they mutually inform and help to define each other.  We will ask how public theatrical institutions and performances and the technology of print contributed to the modern world of proliferating media forms.	Kristina Straub	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 145C
76-815	Mediated Power and Propaganda	None	English	For most of us, the word propaganda triggers a familiar script. We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies. Finally, we will consider how to analyze propaganda, generating methodological prerequisites for scholarly study. Ultimately, students will have the opportunity to conduct their own research on propaganda as it relates to their academic and professional goals.	John Oddo	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A19
76-819	Media in a Digital Age	None	English	How are media in a digital age changing? And how are they changing us? What does it mean to be living in todays communication technology revolution? In a time when many forms of communication are digitally based, traveling as bits at e-speeds on global computer networks? To begin answering these questions, we will take as case studies several new discursive digital media formations, such as digital books, on-line newspapers, blogs, wikis, and so forth, along with related social formations, such as social media and distributed non-profit activist organizations. The readings will provide a range of lens by which to understand these developments, including cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects. We will briefly put the development of communication technologies in their historical context: How were new forms of communication received in the past? How were they used? How did they affect communication? How did they influence political and social institutions? We will focus, however, on using knowledge of historical developments to inform our understandings of current digital communication developments.  Along the way we will ask questions, such as ? What are some of the challenges that new digital formations present to traditional communication theories (e.g., What does authorship look like in massively open online collaborations when the boundaries between reading and authoring are blurred? How is trust established when speakers are anonymous and globally distributed? How are identities discursively constructed? How is the ?public sphere? constituted when Internet search engines dynamically construct it?).	Christine Neuwirth	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 255B
76-821	Why Stories Matter	12.0	English	Storytelling is a key aspect of our experience as human beings; without it we are reduced to, as one scholar put it, the most primitive mode of existence - a life without imaginary alternatives. In this course we will study some key fictions that have provided such imaginary alternatives, alongside various theories for interpreting them. These narratives deal with some of the most important aspects of the human condition: time, justice, empathy, point of view, and reality. The authors we will cover are among the most enduring in the Western tradition, from Sophocles and Chaucer to Melville, Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Ian McEwan. Students will be required to contribute to all class meetings, write brief responses on Blackboard, and produce two substantial essays (longer for grads than undergrads).

76-829	Introduction to Digital Humanities	None	English	This course introduces students to core methods and readings in Digital Humanities, an emerging field thats been called the next big thing in literary and cultural studies. Students will read influential scholarship by Robert Binkley, Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, Peter deBolla, Johanna Drucker, Alan Liu, Jerome McGann, and Bethany Nowviskie and explore successful projects like Linked Jazz, Histography, Wearing Gay History, Colored Conventions, Transcribe Bentham, NYPL Building Inspector, and Six Degrees of Francis Bacon. Graded assignments in the course will include a class presentation (focusing on a single issue of a digital humanities journal), a project proposal, and a final paper or project - collaborative if desired - on a research question of students choice.   In an effort to facilitate non-traditional collaborations, the course is open to (a.) humanities students curious about computational approaches to humanistic questions and (b.) students with technical, data-driven, or design backgrounds interested in contributing to humanistic knowledge.   Students interested in gaining experience with specific digital humanities tools are encouraged to enroll as well in Prof. Ishizakis concurrent Topics in Digital Humanities: Coding for Humanities (76-388/788), a nice complement to this course.

76-839	Stars and Celebrities	12.0	English	Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, Madonna, Kim Kardashian and Caitlin Jenner, Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan are more than just successful entertainers. They are cultural icons rich in both semiotic and emotional investment.  This course will examine some of these stars as texts, and the texts in which they appear. The latter will be drawn heavily from film, but also will include popular music, television, and print. We will work at reading stars to discover their cultural significance, and at understanding the larger phenomenon of celebrity.  We will read works on the theory and history of celebrity and stardom, focusing on the United States since 1910, including those of David Marshall, Joshua Gamson, Richard Dyer, Richard deCordova, Leo Braudy, and others.  We will consider such questions as whether celebrity plays a larger role in culture than it once did, and whether the character of celebrity has changed in fundamental ways.  Students will write a major research paper in addition to regular commentaries on readings and other texts.	David Shumway	2	1830	2120	BH 145C
76-844	History of Books and Reading: Media before "New Media"	12.0	English	Rather than putting an end to the book, digital media have had the oddly exhilarating effect of making us look at all kinds of print, past and present, through newly focused lenses.  This course will introduce you to the history of books and reading, a cross-fertilizing field of study that is having an impact on many disciplines, from the history of science to literary history, cultural studies, and the arts.  We will read scholarship in this still-emerging field to orient you to its key issues, practical and methodological problems, and theoretical implications: work by Roger Chartier, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau, Adrian Johns, and others. Well also read primary texts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries --including Joseph Addison, Jane Austen, Samuel Coleridge, Charles Dickens and others--to see how differing modes of print and reading were keenly contested cultural and political matters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Other topics include the division between new reading publics and their ways of reading books; important changes in book production, typography, printing methods (hand-press to steam press). We will study the relation between the aesthetic powers of the text and the material pleasures of the book; the emergence of a modern, imaginative category of literature in conjunction with the consolidating power of the novel. Such knowledge of the history of print has become especially crucial in an era of emerging new media and the field of digital humanities in the university.	Jon Klancher	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 145C
76-854	Foundations of Cultural Studies	12.0	English	This course will introduce you to important texts, traditions and intellectual concepts associated with literary and cultural studies in the 20th and 21st century.  It will also serve as an introduction to varied way faculty members in the Literary and Cultural Studies program engage with what is broadly understood as literary and cultural studies. We will read key texts in criticism and theory from figures ranging from Theodore Adorno and Stuart Hall to Gayatri Spivak and Jack Halberstam.  We will also hear about the state of the field(s) associated with literary and cultural studies from your professors in the LCS Program. Along with the readings, you will write weekly essays and prepare a conference paper.	Richard Purcell	1	1830	2120	BH 255B
76-870	Professional and Technical Writing	9.0	English	Core course for first-semester MAPW students and Elective Course for CPID students. All other students by permission only.    This core requirement for the MAPW degree introduces you to the theory, research, and practice of professional and technical writing. Through reading, discussion, projects, and writing workshops, you develop a rhetorically-grounded approach to analyzing communications problems and producing a range of effective and situation-specific professional documents. The user-centered approach views professional documents as means to accomplish specific, well-defined purposes: getting funding or support for a project (proposals), supporting managerial decision-making (reports), communicating effectively within organizations (email, correspondence), guiding action (instructional writing), getting a job or internship (resumes and application letters), or making choices among various medical treatments (science writing for general audiences). Because writers need a range of skills that go well beyond the actual inscribing of words on a page, you also gain practice in how to interview subject matter experts, work with clients, test documents on actual users, edit and revise your own work and that of other writers, and participate in and manage collaborative writing projects. The course features five or six major writing assignments, including a final portfolio of revised and polished work.	Necia Werner	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 255B
76-876	Rhetoric of Science	9.0	English	This course broadly explores questions about scientific argument and communication that are of interest to scientists, rhetoric of science scholars, and professional/technical writing practitioners. These include questions like: How are scientific arguments structured? How is scientific information and argument transformed when it moves from research papers to publications for non-specialist audiences? How does the social, historical, and cultural context of science shape the way it is communicated and/or argued?  In what ways might stylistic features of language and thought influence the invention and communication of scientific ideas? What contributions do visuals make to scientific argument and communication?	James Wynn	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A22
76-881	Introduction to Multimedia Design	None	English	There is increasing demand for professional/technical writers who understand multimedia and its communicative possibilities. This class will provide students with the opportunity to develop the ability to analyze and create multimedia experiences that merge text, spoken voice, music, animation and video. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts and vocabulary of multimedia, as well as the practical issues surrounding multimedia design through a series of hands-on projects involving various contexts. Students will explore what it means to write for a dynamic medium and how to take advantage of elements of time, motion and sound to help writers expand their communicative skills. Class discussion and critiques are an essential part of this course.  Students will be taught to work with a variety of available cameras, recorders and other production equipment to create the elements of their projects. While students are not expected to become masters of multimedia software, the essentials of Adobe After Effects, Premiere and Audition will be taught in order to provide the basic skills necessary to complete assignments and explore multimedia possibilities.

76-900	Independent Study in Rhetoric	None	English	An Independent Study course is a course taken with faculty supervision that goes beyond the courses offered in a particular area of interest. It should not duplicate a course offered in the regular schedule of classes. A student wishing to take an independent study needs to locate a faculty member whose research interests are close to the area of proposed study and meet with the faculty member to discuss whether it is something the faculty member is interested in doing. The department requires that the student and instructor submit a written contract (available in the English Department) detailing the expectations (description of course of study, readings, how often the student/faculty member will meet) and requirements for the completed independent study project (number  length of papers) and a time-line for completion of the work. You should think of this as developing the equivalent of a detailed course syllabus/schedule, and typically involves development of a bibliography of readings.	Joanna Wolfe	NA	NA	NA	NA

79-104	Innovation and Social Change	9.0	History	Human activity transcends political, geographical, and cultural boundaries. From wars to social movements, technological innovations to environmental changes, our world has long been an interconnected one. Acquiring the ability to understand such transnational and even worldwide processes is an indispensable part of any college education. This course provides students with an opportunity to develop the skills and perspectives needed to understand the contemporary world through investigating its global history. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

79-164	Freshman Seminar: The Slave Passage: From West Africa to the Americas	9.0	History	The Slave Passage begins among flourishing, technologically advanced, and globally connected Western African societies before the advent of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  It answers questions that have pre-occupied historians for decades: what social, political, and economic factors propelled Western African states and stateless societies to engage in the trans-Atlantic trade in captives?  Did slavery exist in Africa before the advent of European trade?  Who were the Africans who were captured and taken from their homelands?  It tells the painful story of Western Africas transformation as a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and African captives experiences in the horrors of the Middle Passage.    The course bears witness to the humanity of more than 150,000 souls imported from Western Africa to the New World by piecing together the historical record of the Middle Passage and recovering the stories of the suffering captives experienced aboard the slaving vessels and their multiple strategies of resistance.  It examines the changing technology of the slave ships on which they were imprisoned.  Lastly, the course will explore the Creole cultures and languages created by the descendants of enslaved Africans in various ports in the New World.  Students will read and analyze slave narratives, slave ship logs, and autobiographies of former enslaved people, watch and analyze films depicting the Middle Passage and New World enslavement, and engage in public history and/or artistic performances related to the subject matter.

79-200	World War I: Lived Experience, Meanings, and Memory	9.0	History	This course introduces students to methods and materials that historians use to study the past. Its goals are: first, to familiarize students with ways that historians think about their research, how they carry it out, and how they debate findings with other historians; second, to train students in best practices for doing historical research in primary and secondary sources. We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Fall 2016 semester, we will use the topic of World War I to focus the class. In the Spring 2017 semester, we will use the topic of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Work includes reading and discussing a variety of sources; completing short assignments such as primary document analyses, response papers, and reports related to students research topics; occasional oral progress reports to the class, and outlines or drafts. There is a final 10-15 page research paper.	Katherine Lynch	2<>4	0900	1020	BH A54
79-201	Introduction to Anthropology	9.0	History	Cultural anthropologists make the strange familiar and the familiar strange, attempting to understand the internal logic of cultures which might, at first glance, seem bizarre to us, while at the same time probing those aspects of our own society which might appear equally bizarre to outsiders. In doing so, anthropology makes us more aware of our own culturally-ingrained assumptions, while broadening our understanding of the possibilities and alternatives in human experience. This course will use ethnographic writings (descriptive accounts of particular cultures), as well as ethnographic films, to investigate the ways in which diverse societies structure family life, resolve conflict, construct gender relations, organize subsistence, etc. We will assess the advantages and pitfalls of comparing cross-cultural data, analyze the workings of power within and between societies, and consider the politics of cultural representations. We will also discuss the anthropologists relationship to the people s/he studies, and the responsibilities inherent in that relationship. Throughout the course, students will learn the importance of an historical perspective on culture, looking at how and why societies change, and considering how we, as anthropologists, should assess these changes.

79-203	Social and Political Change in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe	9.0	History	During the course, students will develop their knowledge of the geographical, cultural, and political characteristics of 20th century Central and Eastern Europe. By analyzing the sweeping political changes in the region that had occurred in a relatively short historical time, students will better understand the emergence of nationalist movements and radical political ideologies such as socialism and fascism during the interwar period against a backdrop of regional histories of centuries-long inter-ethnic cohabitation. They will also assess to what extent these earlier histories continued to subtly influence the social landscapes of post-1945 Central and Eastern Europe, thus complicating the processes of socialist modernization that the new regimes tried to implement in the region under the close scrutiny of the USSR. Course materials will include not only historical and anthropological readings, but also historical documents, literary texts and films from the region. The assignments will consist of regular participation in class discussions, weekly responses to the readings, two critical essays (each 5-6 pages long), and a final exam.

Some areas of focus will include documentary footage and films of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), films of the Mexican Golden Age (1930-1960), and New Mexican Cinema from the 1990s forward.  We will explore cinema as a window on Mexicos changing social, cultural and political dynamics, and as a way to probe such topics as: changing conceptions of Mexican identity; political critique and revolutionary movements; and urbanization, migration and the drug war in contemporary Mexico.  **Please Note**: in addition to two weekly class meetings, this course also includes a required weekly film screening at 6:30 on Tuesday evenings.

79-232	Arabian Peninsula Environmental History	9.0	History	This course is ONLY offered at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar.    This course will look at the history of the Arabian Peninsula from a fresh  perspective, examining human/environmental interactions over a long  stretch of time. In contrast to the way that Arabian history is typically  taught in academia, this course will take the pre-Islamic period of  Arabian history (al-jahiliyya) as seriously as the post-Islamic period,  and will focus on continuities between the two periods as much as  discontinuities. What is more, while conventional histories of the Arabian  Peninsula focus on political and religious affairs, this course will try  to understand Arabian history on a deeper level by focusing on the  lifeways of the Arabian people, including pastoralism, oasis bustan  garden agriculture, fishing and pearling, and shifting patterns of  long-distance trade. What is more this course will draw heavily from  material from other disciplines, especially medical sciences, to better  understand patterns of change over time. Finally, this course will examine  to what degree these older patterns of human/landscape interactions are  still valid for the Arabian Peninsula today, which has undergone a  transformation almost unparalleled in world history due to the discovery  natural gas and oil.

79-233	The United States and the Middle East since 1945	9.0	History	This course begins by introducing students to the Middle Eastern priorities and policies which the US inherited from the British in the aftermath of the Second World War. The focus then moves to American interests and involvement in the region from the Cold War through today, with special attention to recurrent historical themes. Topics include the US role in the Arab-Israeli conflict and peace process, the role of oil, politics and conflicts in the Persian Gulf, the impact of 9/11 on American foreign policy in the Middle East, and selected case studies of US political and military intervention there. Readings and discussion progress with a dual goal in mind: to understand American foreign policy interests in the Middle East, and to understand the forces and nuances endemic to the region itself. Students will learn how to analyze primary source documents, such as presidential speeches and UN resolutions. The course culminates in a role-playing exercise in which students must establish foreign policy goals and strive top achieve them.	Laurie Eisenberg	1<>3	1230	0120	PH A18A
79-238	The Roots of Black Urban Rebellion in America, 1945 to the Present	6.0	History	This course examines the social, cultural, economic, and political forces that have shaped the African American experience in urban America from the end of the Second World War to the present day. By the end of the course, students will be able to place recent black urban unrest in its historical context. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the causes of urban racial segregation, the Civil Rights Movement, Black Power, the rise of law and order politics, and the War on Drugs.	Kimberly Ellis	2<>4	1200	0120	PH A22
79-242	African American History: Reconstruction to the Present	9.0	History	This course explores changes in the African American experience from the end of the Civil War to the Age of Barack H. Obama.  The course emphasizes transformations in both inter- and intra-race relations; economic mobility as well as economic inequality; and forms of political engagement and grassroots movements for social change.  In Part I, the course opens with an examination of the notion of a Post-Racial Society in the United States.  This idea emerged in the wake of the Modern Black Freedom Movement and persists to this day as the 21st century unfolds. Part II locates the roots of 20th century black life and history in the emancipation of enslaved people in the years after the Civil War. This segment of the course will not only give close attention to the meaning of emancipation and freedom for black people, but also charts the rise of a new Jim Crow social order by World War I.  Third and most important, this course will illuminate the transformation of African American culture, politics, and community under the impact of the 20th century Great Migration; the rise of the urban-industrial working class; increasing residential segregation; growth and expansion of the middle class; and the fluorescence of the Modern Black Liberation Movement.  Students will compare the dynamics of the contemporary Black Lives Matter Movement with earlier 20th century grassroots social and political movements in African American and U.S.  history. Finally, based upon a mix of primary and secondary sources and lectures, students will examine a wide range of intellectual debates in African American history; write a series of short analytical essays; and establish their own unique interpretation of key issues in Black History.

79-250	Running for President: Campaigns & Elections in History of American Presidency	9.0	History	This course examines the history of presidential campaigns, focusing on the institutions, individuals, and events involved in such contests.  Using a variety of texts, ranging from debate transcripts, journalistic accounts, and scholarly works, students will analyze and understand how campaigns have come to take their current form. Though focusing on campaigns in the 20th and 21st centuries, earlier, formative contests will also be discussed, allowing for discussion of how more recent campaigns compare to historical ones.  Since the 2016 General Election will take place during the course, students will have the unique chance to analyze the current contest in both a fresh and historical perspective.

79-252	Exploring the American Century: United States History After 1945	9.0	History	[Note: students who have already taken this course under former title, Recent U.S. History, 1945-Present, may not enroll.] Henry Luce, publisher of TIME magazine, labelled the 20th Century the American Century, a phrase that took on increasing prominence with the economic and cultural boom of the United States in the decades following World War II. This course examines the political, social, and cultural history of the United States after 1945, seeking to answer the question: How did we get from there to here? Readings and class discussion will examine political and economic transformation, social movements, and intellectual debates over American identity and purpose within the context of new technologies, influential popular culture, shifting demographics, and international context. Primary sources, scholarly secondary readings, and period films and media will provide lenses into the broad forces, institutional structures, and lived experiences of recent American history.

79-261	The Last Emperors: Chinese History and Society, 1600-1900	9.0	History	This course is an introduction to late-imperial Chinese history and society with a focus on the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). We begin by examining the Qing not just as the last of Chinas imperial dynasties but also as an early-modern, multi-ethnic empire that included Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang. In fact, Chinas last emperors were actually Manchus from northeast Asia. Secondly we investigate the social, economic, intellectual and demographic developments that transformed late-imperial China prior to the coming of the West. Thirdly, we examine Qing responses to a string of nineteenth-century disruptions, including but not limited to western imperialism, that threatened to not only end the dynasty but also challenged the very tenants of Chinese civilization. Lastly, we will look at the fall of Chinas imperial system, the end of empire, and the post-imperial struggle to reformulate the state and re-imagine society for the twentieth century.

79-265	Russian History: From the First to the Last Tsar	9.0	History	This course covers a broad sweep of Russian history beginning with the first settlements of tribal nomads in the ninth century and ending with the fall of the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty in 1917.  Our course profiles how the Russian state was formed and how its territory expanded to become a mighty  empire.   Over the centuries, we make the acquaintance of Mongol marauders, greedy princes, and peasant rebels, as well as Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and the long succession of reformers and reactionaries who occupied the Russian throne.  We explore terrorism, general strikes, and development of the revolutionary movement that ultimately brought down the Tsar in 1917.	Wendy Goldman	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 235A
79-269	London and the Birth of Modern Britain, 1800 to the Present	6.0	History	London is a city of contradictions. Home to some of the richest institutions in our globalized world -- particularly The Citys banks -- London is also one prominent site of the cultural, economic, and political critique of graffiti artist Banksy. London is the home of beautiful and iconic buildings with storied legacies as well as the multicultural slums of the East End. How did this city of contradictions develop? What does London tell us about the broader development of Great Britain, or the particular challenges wrought by urbanization?  This course examines the history of London from its foundation during the Roman Empire to the present day. In particular, the course will focus on how London became the center of financial, political, and cultural power during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but also home to problems of poverty, sanitation, and crime. Using a range of sources including literature, memoirs, and newspapers, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the history of one of the worlds greatest cities, as well as how London contributed to Great Britains overall development.

79-280	Brewing Revolution? Coffee and Social Change from Adam Smith to Starbucks	6.0	History	First domesticated in the highlands of Ethiopia, coffee has traversed most of the world, often driving profound social, environmental, and political change. Today, coffee is the most valuable internationally traded commodity after oil. Coffee is big business dominated by corporations like Nestle and Starbucks, but coffee also provides livelihoods for millions of family farmers in places as diverse as Colombia, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea.  Beginning with the French/Haitian Revolutions and ending with the Fair Trade Movement, this mini course will use episodes in the history of coffee production and consumption to gain insights on some of todays most pressing problems related to economic inequality, social change, and environmental sustainability. Course meetings will emphasize group discussions; assignments will include journals and short quizzes.	John Soluri	2<>4	0900	1020	BH 237B
79-289	Animal Planet: An Environmental History of People and Animals	6.0	History	Why do modern societies go to great lengths to protect some animals and slaughter others? How do people use animals to demarcate boundaries among themselves and between humans and nature? What are the environmental ramifications of domestication? What role do animals play in visual culture? These are some of the questions that we will seek to answer as we explore the role of human--animal relationships in making the modern world (ca. 1400-present). We will pay particular attention to visual representations of animals across time and cultures. Evaluation will be based on active participation in class discussions, submission of weekly field notes, and a final assignment focused on visual representations of people and animals.

79-294	Islam on the Main Street in the West since the 18th Century	9.0	History	This course is offered only at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar.  This introductory course to the humanities and social sciences through the prism of religion and faith, aims at:  1. analyzing the interaction between these central disciplines and at appreciating the significance of Western and Islamic humanism and applying it to the present context of cultural globalism, confrontation and dialogue; 2. becoming familiar with some important literary texts of the modern era; 3. learning how to articulate ones thoughts in a cogent manner. The discussion will stress how religion, a powerful instrument of socialization may, under some circumstances, foster intolerance and inequality or openmindedness and tolerance. Understanding this process may lead to a new appreciation of classical Western writings.	Lansine Kaba	1<>3	1030	1150	CMB 1202
79-299	From Newton to the Nuclear Bomb: History of Science, 1750-1950	9.0	History	This course provides an introduction to the history of modern science in Europe and North America, from the Enlightenment to the mid-twentieth century. Our goal is to understand scientific theories and practices on their own terms and as products of their own contexts, rather than as a progression of developments moving inevitably toward the present. The course seeks to explore both how and why science has become the dominant way of knowing about the natural world, as well as how scientific activity intersects with the history of religion, war, commerce, and the state. Most of the reading will be from primary sources, likely including Darwin, Einstein, McClintock, Laplace, Joule, Lovelace, and Paley.	Christopher Phillips	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 237B
79-300	History of American Public Policy	9.0	History	This course will describe and analyze aspects of the development of public policy in the United States from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the post-Civil War era.  For the purposes of this course, public policy will be defined as the making of rules and laws and their implementation by government: 1) in response to the failure of private actors (i.e., markets) to reach desirable outcomes; 2) to regulate markets to influence their outcomes; or 3) in an attempt to achieve a particular normative vision of what society ought to be like.  This course assumes that the public policy landscape is complex but still comprehensible given the proper set of analytical frameworks and appropriate historical background.  Particular emphasis will be placed on: changing views about the authority of the government to intervene in economic and social issues; the best way to balance individual and collective interests; and the variability within society of the life courses of individuals.  Topics to be covered include: immigration, health care and health insurance, and education.	Christopher Phillips	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 226A
79-306	Fact into Film: Translating History into Cinema	9.0	History	From the very beginning, film has provided a window into the past.  But how useful are the images we see through that window?  For every person who reads a work of history, thousands will see a film on the same subject.  But who will learn more?  Can written history and filmed history perform the same tasks?  Should we expect them to do so?  How are these two historical forms related?  How can they complement each other?  This course will draw examples from across the history of film in order to examine how the medium of film impacts our understanding of facts and events, the ways that film transfers those facts to the screen, and how that process affects the the creation of historical discourse.  Films may include such titles as The Fall of the Roman Empire, The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Saving Private Ryan, World Trade Center, Enemy at the Gates, Lagaan and Hero.	Jeffrey Hinkelman	2<>4	1200	0120	BH 237B
79-309	The Chinese Revolution Through Film (1949-2000)	9.0	History	This course is about both film and history. It is not a detailed history of film, but rather introduces some key issues of modern Chinese history and examines how that history is treated in film. Most of the films are made in China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) but some are produced in the west. Topics that may be explored include the rise of the Communist Party, life in Maoist China, the Cultural Revolution, the Cold War/anti-imperialism, depictions of Chinas minority peoples, and the Reform-era under Maos successors. Along with feature movies, we may view documentaries, propaganda films, TV shows and even music videos. In addition to providing a general history of the period, accompanying readings and assignments explore the social context and methodology of the films while developing critical skills in writing, analysis, and historical imagination.

79-310	Modern U. S. Business History: 1870 to the Present	9.0	History	This course explores the development of American business within its economic, political, and social context from the late nineteenth century to the present. Through the lens of history of capitalism, readings and discussions will explore the interconnections of State and Market in the twentieth century United States that shaped how, why, and where business transactions occurred. Particular attention will be paid to the institutional, social, technological, environmental, labor, and cultural context in which American commerce developed, from the rise of the modern corporation in the late nineteenth century to the emergence of a true information economy in the twenty-first. Students will encounter primary sources, scholarly secondary readings, business case studies, and cultural artifacts as they explore how business functioned and changed over time in an American context.

79-311	PaleoKitchen: Food and Cooking in the Ancient World	6.0	History	From home cooking to haute cuisine, people are passionate about food. But what did people eat in the ancient world? This class will center around the origins of the human diet, including human dietary adaptation to diverse ecological and technological situations; social, cultural, behavioral, and ecological factors which influenced diet in ancient societies; and the origins of cuisines around the world.	Lauren Herckis	2<>4	1030	1150	DH 1117
79-312	Archaeology of Death	6.0	History	Ancient tombs, dusty crypts, frozen bodies, mummies, and cemeteries are the stuff of adventure and fiction. Archaeologists examine causes of death in the past, and study how ancient peoples dealt with the dead, to learn about life in the past. This course will explore mortuary patterns (the treatment of the dead) in order to reconstruct prehistoric social organization. We will also discuss archaeological approaches to paleopathology and patterns of mortality in past populations.	Lauren Herckis	2<>4	1030	1150	DH 1117
79-315	The Politics of Water: Global Controversies, Past and Present	9.0	History	Water is necessary for all forms of life on Earth. With a global population of 7 billion humans, an estimated 1 billion suffer from inadequate drinking water; an estimated 2 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities for human health, safety, and dignity.   The purpose of this course is to introduce students to critical studies of water and development, using in-depth case studies that draw upon a variety of historical and social scientific perspectives. Examples of regional water projects addressed might include traditional tank irrigation in South India; international negotiations among states along the Nile River; historical changes in farming and landscape use in central China; and the U.S. Government in negotiation with native activists and fisheries experts on the Columbia River. In addition to this regional variety, readings will explore thematic approaches, for example, water and gender, water and armed conflict, and water and privatization interests.  By the end of this course, students should be able to articulate their own answers to these questions: How have global organizations and participants characterized, enacted, and addressed problems of water supply and delivery for those who need it most? How do particular regions reflect global trends in water resource development, and how might these diverge from global trends? How have social and environmental studies in the literature of development come to understand the problem of water?  All students should be prepared to read widely, and to discuss readings in a thoughtful way during each class meeting.	Abigail Owen	1<>3	1200	0120	PH 125B
79-316	Photography, the First 100 Years, 1839-1939	9.0	History	Photography was announced to the world almost simultaneously in 1839, first in France and then a few months later in England. Accurate likenesses of people were available to the masses, and soon reproducible images of faraway places were intriguing to all. This course will explore the earliest image-makers Daguerre and Fox Talbot, the Civil War photographs organized by Mathew Brady, the introduction in 1888 of the Kodak by George Eastman, the critically important social documentary photography of Jacob Riis and his successor, Lewis Hine, the Photo-Secession of Alfred Stieglitz, the Harlem Renaissance of James VanDerZee, the precisionist f64 photographers Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, and Edward Weston, and other important photographers who came before World War II. The class will be introduced to 19th century processes, such as the daguerreotype, tintype, and ambrotype, as well as albumen prints, cyanotypes, and more.

79-317	Art, Anthropology, and Empire	9.0	History	This seminar will explore the anthropology and history of aesthetic objects, as they travel from places considered primitive or exotic, to others deemed civilized or Western. First, we will consider twentieth-century anthropological attempts to develop ways of appreciating and understanding objects from other cultures, and in the process to reconsider the meaning of such terms as art and aesthetics. Then we will discuss several topics in the history of empire and the exotic arts, including: the conquest, colonization and appropriation of indigenous objects; the politics of display and the rise of museums and world fairs; the processes by which locally-produced art objects are transformed into commodities traded in international art markets; the effects of exotic art on such aesthetic movements as surrealism, etc.; and the appropriation of indigenous aesthetic styles by Western artists. Finally, we will consider attempts by formerly colonized populations to reclaim objects from museums, and to organize new museums, aesthetic styles, and forms of artistic production that challenge imperialisms persistent legacies.	Paul Eiss	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 235A
79-322	Stalin and the Great Terror	6.0	History	In the late 1930s, the Soviet state initiated a series of executions, purges, and arrests of its own citizens.  More than 500,000 people were executed, and over one million sent to prison.  This period is now known as the Great Terror.  The Terror began with the assassination of a prominent official.  Yet it soon snowballed from a hunt for terrorists into a broad Terror against innocent people.   How did a single assassination spark such a tragic campaign?  How does anti-terrorist campaign snowball into an attack against ever widening numbers of  ordinary citizens?  Why did Stalin and the Soviet state secret police execute and arrest so many people?  Taking us back to those dark days, this course examines what it was like to live in a culture of fear and denunciation, and how historians now seek to explain it.	Wendy Goldman	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A22
79-327	Modern Girlhood: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives	6.0	History	Through primary documents, film and popular media, material culture, and interdisciplinary scholarship from the emerging field of girl(hood) studies, this course will examine historical conceptions of girlhood and accounts of girls lives, to contemporary concerns and representations. In seeking to understand the meaning and experience of modern girlhood, our focus will primarily be on the 20th and 21st century American experiences, though at times we may look to perspectives from earlier periods and elsewhere in the world. Because there is no single experience or representation of girlhood, we will pay attention to the ways that girlhood is lived and constructed through the frameworks of race, class, culture, and geographic specificity.	Carrie Hagan	1<>3	1500	1620	DH 1209
79-331	Body Politics: Women and Health in America	9.0	History	Womens bodies have been the sites of long-standing, and sometimes deadly, political battles. This course takes a topical approach to the history of American womens health in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in order to understand why womens bodies have been such heated sites of struggle. It covers topics such as the history of contraception, abortion, menstruation, sexuality, female anatomy, rape, domestic abuse, menopause, pregnancy, and childbirth. It explores how American culture has constructed these issues over time, while also examining womens organizing around them.  This course is open to all students.	Lisa Tetrault	1<>3	1330	1450	GHC 4101
79-333	Sex, Gender & Anthropology	9.0	History	This course introduces students to an anthropological perspective on the relationship between sex (biological) and gender (cultural).  In order to understand the various debates we will examine the ideas of manhood, womanhood, third genders and sexuality in cross-cultural perspective.  The focus will be on non-western cultures and will examine the construction of status, sexuality, and gender roles within the broader context of ritual, symbolism, marriage, kinship.  Utilizing film, the popular media, and anthropological case studies this course will provide students with ways to understand and question how and why we express ourselves as men, women, and other.

79-336	Oil & Water: Middle East Perspectives	6.0	History	This course provides an introduction to the rapidly growing field of global environmental history, while using regional case studies from the geographic region of what is now the Middle East. It highlights key issues in global history, seeking ways to examine Middle East history from a global historical perspective.  Several themes in environmental history will receive special attention, including: agricultural systems; water resources; climate variability; the temporalities of natural resources; and narratives of development. In addition, we will examine the historiography, or changing assumptions over time, of historians and other scholars who have studied the environmental resources of the Middle East.

79-352	Christendom Divided: The Protestant and Catholic Reformation, 1450-1650	9.0	History	At the dawn of the sixteenth century, western Europeans still shared a common religion and identity as members of the Roman Catholic Church. Within less than two decades, this uniformity began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered. By 1550, Europe was splintered into various conflicting churches, confessions, sects, and factions, each with its own set of truths and its own plan for reforming the church and society at large. This period of rapid and unprecedented change in western history is commonly known as the Reformation. Though this term has traditionally referred to the birth of Protestantism, it also encompasses the simultaneous renewal and reform that occurred within Roman Catholicism. This course will survey the Reformations of the sixteenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, examining the causes of the Reformation, the dynamics of reform, and its significance for western society and culture. In the process, we will analyze such on-going problems as religious persecution and the accommodation of dissent, the relationship between religion and politics, and the interactions between ideology and political, social, and economic factors in the process of historical change.	Allyson Creasman	2<>4	1330	1450	SH 208
79-358	Nazi Ghettos: From Spatial Segregation to Killing Zones	6.0	History	The Nazis demarcated more than 800 ghettos for interning the Jewish population of the territory they occupied during WWII.  Some ghettos lasted for only a short period before they were destroyed; some lasted for years. Most were placed in towns or cities, but others were in rural areas.  Some were designed as labor camps, and in a few, families and communities did manage to survive the war.   Our course will focus on the East European ghettos, examining how they emerged, their function in the Nazi system, and their development from areas of spatial segregation to killing zones aimed at the annihilation of the people they contained.  The course will examine Jewish life within the ghettos, social and cultural gaps, the Judenrat (Jewish councils appointed by the Nazis), and Jewish alternative leadership.  We will also look at the uprising within the Warsaw ghetto, which resulted in its total destruction. By analyzing the development of the Ghetto as an urban disaster zone, we will seek to comprehend changes in the concept of ghettos by their inhabitants and by the oppressors.  Using a case study approach, we will focus on the Warsaw Ghetto as a blockade within the surrounding city, the Lodz Ghetto as labor camp, the Mogilev and Zhmerinka ghettos (which remained relatively open under Romanian occupation but were part of a program of ethnic cleansing), and the ghettos in Vilnius and Bialystok, each of which raised horrific dilemmas of leadership among the imprisoned Jewish population.

79-395	The Arts in Pittsburgh	9.0	History	This course will examine the arts in Pittsburgh, both historically and in the present. We will focus especially on art exhibits and musical events scheduled by the citys museums and concert halls during the semester. The curriculum will derive from the artistic presentations themselves, which will provide a springboard for reading assignments, seminar discussions, and research papers in the history of music and art. We will also examine the historical development of cultural institutions in Pittsburgh. The History Department will pay for students admission to all museums and studios. However, students will be charged a supplemental fee of a minimum of 275 to help subsidize the considerable expense of purchasing tickets for concerts and performances by the Pittsburgh Symphony, Pittsburgh Opera, Chamber Music Society, and Renaissance and Baroque Society. Attendance at all art exhibits and musical events is required.  Prerequisite: Availability to attend art exhibits on several Fridays and Saturdays, and to attend musical events on several Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings.	Naum Kats	1	1830	2120	PH A22

79-420	Historical Research Seminar	12.0	History	The purpose of this research seminar is to help you conceptualize, design, organize, and execute a substantial research project that embodies and extends the knowledge and skill set you have been developing as a History major at Carnegie Mellon.  The identification and collection of relevant primary source data, and the positioning of your project within a relevant historiography, are integral parts of this intellectual task.     Along the way, we will strive to hone your written and oral presentation skills, deepen your command of research methodologies and strategies, and sharpen your abilities as a constructive critic of others research.  The seminar seeks to develop these intellectual skills through a combination of in-class, student-led discussions of everyones research-in-progress, and regular individual consultations with the instructor.

79-437	The Crucible of Modernity: Vienna 1900	9.0	History	Vienna at the turn of the century (that is, at the turn of the last century, 1900) was many things: the political center of the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the meeting place of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians, Slavs, Poles, Italians, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Germans; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism and of psychoanalysis; the battleground for liberalism and anti-Semitism; a haven for socialism; the home of caf-culture and the waltz; the garrison for an outdated army; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; the center for Enlightenment public policy and reactionary bureaucracy; and the showcase for historicism. And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings - and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.

79-439	(Un)Happiness in Russian Life and Art	9.0	History	In one of his novels, Fyodor Dostoevsky poses an urgent question to readers: Which is better: cheap happiness, or exalted suffering? Well, which is better? Happinesswhat it means, how to measure it, and how to achieve itis something we often ponder in private, but increasingly it is something we think about publicly, too. The subject comes up as often in international policy debates as it does in dorm rooms. The United Nations now issues reports on global happiness. But what is happiness? How does it differ from place to place, from one time to another? This course will examine happiness as a concept in Russian and Soviet culture, one that was fiercely contested during key moments of radical change, such as the Bolshevik Revolution, Stalinism, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Through a wide range of works by Russian writers (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky), artists (Malevich), and filmmakers (Eisenstein, Tarkovsky), students will become familiar with how different ideas of happiness have shaped Russian life and art, and develop a critical perspective on contemporary discussions of happiness. The course will be conducted entirely in English, and no prior knowledge of Russian or familiarity with Russian culture is required. Students should expect to complete reading assignments, participate in class discussions, and write three short essays. There will also be opportunities for students to interact with members of the Russian-speaking community in Pittsburgh.	Tatyana Gershkovich	2<>4	1530	1650	BH 154A
79-449	EHPP Project Course	12.0	History	The Ethics, History and Public Policy Project Course is required for the Ethics, History and Public Policy major and is taken in the fall semester of the senior year. In this capstone course, Ethics, History and Public Policy majors carry out a collaborative research project that examines a compelling current policy issue that can be illuminated with historical research and philosophical and policy analysis.

Majors, working in close consultation with the Global Studies director and advisor, will arrange an internship with a non-governmental organization (usually in Pittsburgh) whose mission has a global reach. This could include an organization that supports projects in other countries, works with immigrants in the Pittsburgh area, or participates in international policy making/governance. We strongly encourage students to seek out opportunities that require use of a second language. Students will be required to maintain a weekly journal; write a short critical reflection on how the internship connects to academic work; and share their experience with other Global Studies majors. Global Studies advisor and director will assist students with matching their interests to local organizations and identifying an on-site supervisor available to collaborate in the ongoing and final evaluation of the students work. Prerequisite: Students must be Global Studies majors and obtain permission for the proposed internship from the Global Studies advisor.	John Soluri	NA	NA	NA	NA

79-704	Proseminar in U.S. History	12.0	History	This course examines American history and historiography from the colonial era to the 1960s. A few generations ago, such a course might have aimed to reveal the essence of America. The new social history inspired American historians to be more precise but no less ambitious. We are now tasked with approaching history from multiple perspectives that account for differences of race, class, gender, sexuality, religion, region, and other forms of difference. Our challenge is not to reify difference, however. As transnational history has made clear, our challenge is to trace connections across difference, to think about the fragment and the whole simultaneously. To do that, we will have to work together, learn from each other, and be open to being surprised. This course is limited to doctoral students in the department of history, except by written permission of the instructor.	Lisa Tetrault	3	0930	2420	BH 246A
79-731	Topics in the History of the African Diaspora	12.0	History	This course examines a series of topics in the development of the African Diaspora and connections between West and West Central Africa, New World societies, and other global societies of African-descent.  In addition to acquainting students with the historiography of the African Diaspora, the course will seek to answer the following questions:  how do we define the African Diaspora?  What role do Africans, African-Americans, slavery, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and voluntary migration play in its evolution?  Does continuity or discontinuity characterize the cultures that African descended people have created in the New World?  What similarities and differences exist between the historical experiences of African-descended people in different parts of the world?  What methodological challenges are inherent in researching and writing the history of people of African descent and others around the world that have not left a plethora of traditional historical sources? Most importantly, Topics in the History of the African Diaspora seeks to encourage students, whether their major fields are in US, African American, or European history, to develop the comparative and global dimensions of these fields for research and teaching purposes.  The course material is by nature comparative and thematic.  Each week, the required readings feature studies on a particular theme located in different sub-regions within in the African Diaspora.  However, the course is intentionally designed to have a significant number of US readings, particularly to serve the needs of graduate students studying 20th century US and African American history.  It is my hope that these selections will assist students to prepare for their qualifying exams, to teach comparative courses, possibly even to undertake primary research.This course is limited to doctoral students in the department of history, except by written permission of the instructor.

80-100	Introduction to Philosophy	9.0	Philosophy	In this introductory course we will explore three major areas of Philosophy: Ethics, Metaphysics, and Epistemology. Accordingly the course is divided into three sections. In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.

80-104	Freshman Seminar: Voting Theory	9.0	Philosophy	Voting Theory, with applications to Presidential politics      The class will study some basic voting theory, including issues of constitutional  design, voting paradoxes, and spatial models of candidates and voters strategic  behaviors.      Relating to our theoretical inquiry, we will examine several ways in which the  Internet functions during the ongoing 2012 US Presidential campaign.

80-107	Freshman Seminar: Interstellar Linguistics	9.0	Philosophy	In this seminar we bring together linguistics, the study of human language, with the study of interstellar communication, that is, the attempt to contact and communicate with intelligent life on other planets. In certain respects, the field linguist seeking to discover the meaning and organization of words and phrases in an unfamiliar language is in a similar position to the scientist attempting to design systems to communicate with alien beings. The linguist brings a wealth of experience to the problem, with a history of success in decoding languages currently spoken as well as written scripts from languages long forgotten. The interstellar communicator has as yet no evidence of success, facing the added challenge that any such communication is most likely one-way, and that the intended audience may not even exist. Still, both are dealing with arbitrary systems of signs the meaning of which cannot be inferred directly from form. The aim of this seminar, then, is to apply lessons from linguistics to the problem of devising systems for interstellar communication, while at the same time applying lessons learned from that exercise to issues in communication between humans using natural language. Students will examine past and recent attempts to design interstellar language and they will look at case studies in which difficult or dead languages have been decoded. They will then try their hand at devising solutions to communication problems, between worlds and here on earth.	Thomas Werner	2<>4	1500	1620	DH 1209
80-130	Introduction to Ethics	9.0	Philosophy	As human beings, we frequently grapple with difficult moral questions. How ought I treat my friends and peers? What kinds of policies should a government adopt? When, if ever, can we justify harm? These are the kinds of questions we will consider as we survey the most prominent, contemporary ethical theories. Along the way, we will consider the implications of those theories for real world ethical issues, including capital punishment, pornography, and universalized healthcare.	Robert Cavalier	1<>3<>5	1230	0120	BH 235B
80-180	Nature of Language	9.0	Philosophy	Language is used to talk about the world or to describe it, but how do we go about describing language itself? Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description.   The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them.   Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.

80-201	Epistemology	9.0	Philosophy	What does it mean to have knowledge? How do we know things, and what can be known? These are some of the central questions in the discipline of epistemology (the theory of knowledge). The answers to these questions are not as obvious as some casual thought may suggest. If you think the senses provide us with knowledge, how will you know when your senses deceive you? If you think knowledge is gained through reasoning, where will you start reasoning? This course investigates these questions, focusing on both classic questions and treatments and more recent work in the field of social epistemology. There are no prerequisites, but students may find previous experience with philosophical reasoning to be helpful. Students both with and without such experience are encouraged to take the class.

80-210	Logic and Proofs	9.0	Philosophy	This web-based course introduces students to central issues in logic and develops their ability for constructing and refuting arguments. It addresses the question: How can one analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material.	Mate Szabo	5	1230	0120	WEH 4623

80-211	Logic and Mathematical Inquiry	9.0	Philosophy	Since ancient times, mathematical arguments have served as a paradigm for rational inquiry. This course studies the structure of such arguments and their applications. We will study foundational mathematical concepts and informal proofs, as they appear in everyday mathematics. At the same time, in parallel, we will study mathematical logic, which provides formal symbolic languages for mathematics. The course will make use of a computational proof assistant to develop fully rigorous, machine-checked proofs. This course prepares students to take the 310-311 series on the fundamental (in)completeness and (un)decidability theorems of modern logic.	Jeremy Avigad<>Robert Lewis	1<>3<>5	1430	1520	PH A19
80-223	Causality and Probability	9.0	Philosophy	Does smoking cause cancer? What causes global warming? Would World War II happen if World War I had never happened? In our daily life and science, people often attempt to answer such causal questions, and probability theory, as a mathematical model of uncertainty, serves as a fundamental tool. This course explores the history of causality and probability and the basic methodologies for causal inference and statistical analysis.  In particular, we will study what causality is, how it is related to and different from correlation, the relationship between causality and regression, the benefit of using causal knowledge, the classical ways to find causal relations, when it is possible to achieve so from purely observational data, and machine learning methods for discovering causal structure.	Clark Glymour<>Kun Zhang	2<>4	1500	1620	SH 220
80-226	Revolutions in Science	9.0	Philosophy	Contemporary science emerged in the 17th century from a series of dramatic innovations in theory and method that has come to be called the Scientific Revolution. Since then, science has been punctuated by repeated revolutions in which scientists have been forced to select among dramatically different frameworks for explaining the world: is the Earth or the sun at the center of the solar system? Do kinds of organisms develop from other kinds, or is each created independently? Is matter infinitely divisible or are all things made of atoms in a void? The way scientists choose one framework over another can tell us something about the nature of science. In this course, we will focus on episodes of scientific change to gain insight into a range of questions:  Is scientific change governed by a single method or does each new revolution involve the invention of a new scientific method? How do scientists argue for the existence of unobservable processes, properties, or objects like atoms? In what way do these arguments differ from those of their ancient predecessors? What makes them compelling? Well begin our investigation by examining the overthrow of ancient Greek astronomy and physics by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. We will then turn to a number of subsequent revolutions in other areas of science such as chemistry, geology, and evolutionary biology. Students will work with original texts by Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and others.	Joel Smith	1<>3	1330	1450	WEH 5302
80-230	Ethical Theory	9.0	Philosophy	Every day, even in very subtle ways, we make judgments of value that shape our lives and our conduct. This course will examine four influential attempts at providing a systematic account of the source and nature of moral value, its relationship to other kinds of value, and the practical implications of different answers to these questions. This focus on the fundamental structure of moral value will frequently engage topics such as the nature of the good, subjectivist and objectivist accounts of value, forms of moral naturalism verses attempts at moral constructivism, and will draw on historical as well as more contemporary  sources. Particular attention will be paid to articulating the specific sources of disagreement that distinguish competing moral theories in order to facilitate our ability to adjudicate between them on a reasoned basis.	David Gray	1<>3	1500	1620	CMB 1031
80-247	Ethics and Global Economics	9.0	Philosophy	This course will examine contemporary ethical issues in global economics, and consider what obligations states and individuals have in resolving those issues. Along the way, we will ask questions like: What are the advantages and disadvantages of international trade? What do economically and technologically advanced states owe developing states? To answer these and other questions, we will apply ethical frameworks to a series of case studies in global economics. Readings will be drawn from philosophy, economics, political science, and public media (newspapers, magazines, etc.).	Aidan Kestigian	1<>3<>5	1430	1520	GHC 5222
80-250	Ancient Philosophy	9.0	Philosophy	This course will cover Ancient Greek philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the later Hellenistic writers. We will prepare the background for Socrates and Plato by tracing the various historical and intellectual movements that led up to and through the flourishing and downfall of Periclean Athens. A study of Socrates (as represented in Aristophanes comedy and Platos early dialogues) will lead to an in-depth reading of Platos Gorgias, Symposium and sections of the Republic. We will approach Aristotle through his practical philosophy as presented in the Nicomachean Ethics. The final sections will discuss the Epicurean, Skeptic, and Stoic movements as well as the work of Cicero. Excerpts from other works of Plato and Aristotle as well as Martha Nussbaums recent work on Aristotle and Hellenistic philosophy will accompany selected parts of the course.	Robert Cavalier	1<>3<>5	1530	1620	PH 225B
80-256	Modern Moral Philosophy	9.0	Philosophy	This course will follow moral theory through the modern era (roughly 1600-1900), with special emphasis on the works of Hobbes, Hume, and Kant, as well as the development of utilitarianism.  Since moral theorizing was only one part of these thinkers? larger systems of philosophy, it cannot be fully separated from questions of metaphysics and epistemology (e.g. free will, determinism, materialism, etc.), and well spend some time situating their ethical thought within their larger projects.  In doing so, well also examine these theories within the context of the rapidly changing social, political, and scientific landscape of the modern period.	Derrick Gray	1<>3	1330	1450	PH A22
80-261	Empiricism and Rationalism	9.0	Philosophy	A central issue in Western philosophy has been whether reason or experience (or some of both?) lies at the foundation of human knowledge, and the 17th and 18th centuries are a defining period of European history because they contribute the basic model of science and the ideals of intellectual and political enlightenment that are still dominant today. Specifically, we will focus on the problems encountered in trying to give an adequate account of the nature of the external world, the structure of our minds, and the nature and limitations of knowledge in the thought of Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume. The course has two main goals: (1) to study the metaphysical and epistemological theories of selected philosophers, paying close attention to the arguments offered on behalf of often very strange positions, and (2) to help you improve your analytical and critical skills, including, for example, extracting and evaluating philosophical arguments.	Clark Glymour	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 150
80-270	Philosophy of Mind	9.0	Philosophy	The mind poses one of the greatest challenges to understanding how the world works. What is a mind? What is consciousness? What is sensing? What is agency? How are these facets of subjectivity related to the objective, physical world? In this course, we tackle these challenging questions with a philosophical approach that highlights analysis and argument, though we will also bring in relevant empirical understanding of the mind and brain to enrich our discussion (a complementary course, Philosophy and Psychology, is taught in alternate years where the empirical issues are the focus with enrichment from philosophy). A central practical aim of this course is to promote development of analytical skills through practice engaging with arguments.	Wayne Wu	2<>4	1030	1150	PH 125B
80-282	Phonetics and Phonology I	9.0	Philosophy	This course aims to provide students with practical tools for the study of speech sounds. The acoustic properties of sounds are examined using spectrograms and other devices, with emphasis on vowels and sonorant consonants. Following this, basic phonological notions are covered, tracing their development in the twentieth century up through optimality theory. In optimality theory, contrast and allophonic variation are explained in terms of an input-output device which selects the most harmonic candidate still faithful to phonemes in the input. The course should be relevant not only to linguistics students, but to students of language generally, with applications to sociolinguistics, child language development, speech recognition technologies, and the study of foreign languages.	Thomas Werner	2<>4	1200	0120	DH 1217
80-284	Invented Languages	9.0	Philosophy	Language is normally something that develops and and changes organically within human communities, without much in the way of organized design or invention. Over the centuries, however, many have succumbed to what J. R. R. Tolkien called the secret vice of language creation.  The purposes of these invented languages have been diverse. Some, like Tolkiens Elvish languages, Okrands Klingon, and Petersons Dothaki and Trigedasleng have been designed for artistic or entertainment purposes: they have set out to be natural languages within fictional worlds. Others, like Zamenhofs Esperanto, Browns Loglan, and Elgins Ladan have tried to address perceived inadequacies of the natural languages that their creators saw in the world around them. The of study language invention is thus both the study of a distinctive art form, and an exploration of the history of how people have thought about language in different ages and societies.  In this course, we will explore the linguistic considerations involved in language invention, and the linguistic lessons of the history of invented languages, with a particular emphasis on applying these insights to our own language invention projects. Over the course of the semester, students will be expected to develop invent their own languages, and to complete various shorter assignments to supplement relevant ideas and skills. This course does not assume any background in linguistics, and is intended to accommodate both newcomers and advanced students.	Benjamin George	2<>4	1330	1450	SH 212
80-286	Words and Word Formation: Introduction to Morphology	9.0	Philosophy	How many words do you know?  Is gonna one word or two?  How many meanings does unlockable have?  If someone can be inept, why cant they be ept?  In this course we study the lingusitics of words and word formation, known as morphology.  We begin by asking what a word is, about the internal structure of words, and how new words are formed.  Throughout, we will consider these questions from a cross-linguistic perspective, looking at morphological data from a wide range of languages.  We will also consider how morphology interacts with other subfields of linguistics, including phonology, syntax and semantics.  Finally, we will survey morphological questions from the perspectives of language acquisition, psychology, and cognitive science.	Christina Bjorndahl	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 150

80-305	Rational Choice	9.0	Philosophy	This course is an introduction to formal models of choice and decision-making. We begin by examining choice under certainty, developing both qualitative and quantitative models of preference. We then expand our analysis to take into account uncertainty: we examine the von Neumann-Morgenstern theory of expected utility, the Anscombe-Aumann account, and Savages classic axioms. Empirical challenges to models are emphasized throughout, in response to which we will consider a variety of alternative representations of uncertainty (e.g., Dempster-Shafer belief functions, non-unique probability measures) and preference (e.g., framing effects, prospect theory).	Teddy Seidenfeld	1<>3	1030	1150	PH A18C
80-310	Formal Logic	9.0	Philosophy	Among the most significant developments in modern logic is the formal analysis of the notions of provability and logical consequence for the logic of relations and quantification, known as first-order logic. These notions are related by the soundness and completeness theorems: a logical formula is provable if and only if it is true under every interpretation. This course provides a formal specification of the syntax and semantics of first-order logic and then proves the soundness and completeness theorems. Other topics may include: basic model theory, intuitionistic, modal, and higher-order logics.	Steven Awodey	2<>4	1200	0120	MM A14
80-315	Modal Logic	9.0	Philosophy	This course is an introduction to mathematical modal logic and its applications in philosophy, computer science, linguistics, and economics. We begin with a rigorous development of propositional modal logic: the basic language, interpretation in relational structures, axiom systems, proofs, and validity. We prove soundness and completeness of various systems using the canonical model method, study model equivalences and expressivity results, establish the finite model property, and discuss decidability and basic complexity results. We also consider topological semantics as an alternative to relational semantics, and investigate the connection between the two. Finally, we introduce modal predicate logic, incorporating first-order quantification into the system. In the latter part of the course we turn our attention to more specialized logical systems and their applications, as determined by the interests of the class. Topics may include: epistemic and doxastic logics, multi-agent systems and the notion of common knowledge (with applications to game theory), deontic logics, logics for reasoning about counterfactuals, temporal and dynamic logics, public announcement logic, justification logic, and others.	Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1330	1450	DH 4303
80-324	Philosophy of Economics	9.0	Philosophy	The science of economics has come to occupy a central position in contemporary society. Because of this central position in political decision making, economics is intertwined with a number of other philosophical issues surrounding justice, rights, and fairness. The central theme of this course will be on the arguments in favor and against markets as effective solutions to political problems. This issue will allow us to analyze a wide number of foundational issues in economics including the testability of economic claims, the use of rationality postulates, the foundation of the right to property, and measuring the success or failure of an economy.	Kevin Zollman	2<>4	0900	1020	WEH 5312
80-334	Social and Political Philosophy	9.0	Philosophy	Political philosophers are interested in whether, and to what extent, government use of coercion can be justified.  This question involves many facets, including what gives the government the legitimate authority (if any) to coercively enforce the rules, what limits there are (if any) to the legitimate kinds of rules the government can enforce (and why), what obligations (if any) the government has to the citizens that are governed by its rules, and what claims (if any) citizens of a state can make upon one another.  This course provides a systematic investigation of such questions as well as the concepts that are often appealed to in political theory, such as justice, equality, and fairness.  Readings will be comprised of classic and contemporary theorists from within the liberal political tradition as well as theorists critical of this tradition and its ability to live up to the lofty ideals it espouses.	Danielle Wenner	2<>4	1200	0120	BH 235B
80-335	Deliberative Democracy: Theory and Practice	9.0	Philosophy	Over the past 20 years, deliberative democracy has emerged as a major political theory. As a theory, it has also influenced the development of a number of grassroots organizations such as EveryDay Democracy and has led to a number of democratic innovations, such as Deliberative Polls.   This course will look at the history and concepts that form the background for the theory of deliberative democracy. We will also explore the connection between the theory and its practical applications. Finally, we will see how the theory and practice of deliberative democracy can work at the local, state and national level. Examples will be drawn from Campus and Community Conversations as well as larger initiatives designed to inform public policy in areas such as same-sex marriage, climate change and the issue of abortion in America.	Robert Cavalier	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 150
80-371	Philosophy of Perception	9.0	Philosophy	This will be a course that covers the philosophy of perception from an empirical perspective. The first third of the course will begin with the problem of perception: how to account for the subjective quality of perception. We will explore theoretical challenges to providing an explanation of this feature (which we can call consciousness) and canvas theories that try to provide explanations. In the last two-thirds of the course, we focus on the science as a way of understanding subjective experience. We look carefully at color perception, olfaction, integration in the senses and the role of attention. This course will be a joint seminar between CMU and Pitt and will be co-taught with students from both campuses attending. It will be an upper level course meeting once a week and a high level of discussion, writing and preparation is expected. While there are no prerequisites, students might be aided by having at least one course in philosophy (preferably philosophy of mind or philosophy and psychology) or coursework in perceptual psychology or neuroscience.	Wayne Wu	4	1330	1620	MI 115
80-413	Category Theory	9.0	Philosophy	Category theory is a formal framework devoted to studying the structural relationships between mathematical objects. Developed in the mid-20th century to attack geometrical problems, subsequent progress has revealed deep connections to algebra and logic, as well as to mathematical physics and computer science. The course emphasizes two perspectives. On one hand, we develop the basic theory of categories, regarded as mathematical structures in their own right. At the same time, we will consider the application of these results to concrete examples from logic and algebra. Some familiarity with abstract algebra or logic required.

80-449	EHPP Project Course	12.0	Philosophy	The Ethics, History and Public Policy Project Course is required for the Ethics, History and Public Policy major and is taken in the fall semester of the senior year. In this capstone course, Ethics, History and Public Policy majors carry out a collaborative research project that examines a compelling current policy issue that can be illuminated with historical research and philosophical and policy analysis. The students develop an original research report based on both archival and contemporary policy analysis and they present their results to a client organization in the community.

80-516	Causality and Learning	None	Philosophy	Causal connections are usually more informative and helpful than associational information, especially in understanding, control, decision-making, and prediction in changing environments. In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning and statistics for tackling long-standing causality problems, such as how to discover causal knowledge from purely observational data and how to infer the effect of interventions using such data. Furthermore, recently it has been shown that causal information can facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning problems.  This course explores how causality is different from and related to association, recent machine learning methods for causal discovery, and why and how the causal perspective helps in machine learning.

80-521	Seminar on Formal Epistemology	None	Philosophy	This seminar focuses on epistemic logic, with particular emphasis on topological representations. No background in topology is necessary, though some familiarity with modal logic will be very helpful. The format is presentation-style: each student will be expected to prepare (in consultation with the professor) and present approximately two papers over the course of the semester. We will tackle a series of topics, beginning with foundational and introductory works and progressing to articles of current research; topics will include general modal logic, epistemic/doxastic logic, topological semantics, subset space semantics, and public announcements. Additional topics will be chosen based on the interests and suggestions of those in the seminar.	Kevin Kelly	1<>3	1030	1150	DH 4303

80-600	Philosophy Core Seminar I	12.0	Philosophy	This seminar will focus on classic writings in 20th-century philosophy in order to introduce students to a substantial part of the modern philosophical canon. Topics will include key debates in many areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, social  political philosophy, and others.  Note: This course is required for all first-year graduate students in the Philosophy Department.	Alex London<>Mandy Simons	3	1330	1620	DH 4303
80-603	Formal Methods I	6.0	Philosophy	The formal methods seminar series introduces a variety of formal structures that have broad applicability to issues of philosophical interest. This mini focuses on decision theory and game theory.	Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1500	1620	DH 4303
80-605	Rational Choice	None	Philosophy	This course is an introduction to formal models of choice and decision-making. We begin by examining choice under certainty, developing both qualitative and quantitative models of preference. We then expand our analysis to take into account uncertainty: we examine the von Neumann-Morgenstern theory of expected utility, the Anscombe-Aumann account, and Savage?s classic axioms. Empirical challenges to models are emphasized throughout, in response to which we will consider a variety of alternative representations of uncertainty (e.g., Dempster-Shafer belief functions, non-unique probability measures) and preference (e.g., framing effects, prospect theory).	Teddy Seidenfeld	1<>3	1030	1150	PH A18C
80-610	Formal Logic	12.0	Philosophy	Among the most significant developments in modern logic is the formal analysis of the notions of provability and logical consequence for the logic of relations and quantification, known as first-order logic. These notions are related by the soundness and completeness theorems: a logical formula is provable if and only if it is true under every interpretation. This course provides a formal specification of the syntax and semantics of first-order logic and then proves the soundness and completeness theorems. Other topics may include: basic model theory, intuitionistic, modal, and higher-order logics.	Steven Awodey	2<>4	1200	0120	MM A14
80-615	Modal Logic	None	Philosophy	This course is an introduction to mathematical modal logic and its applications in philosophy, computer science, linguistics, and economics. We begin with a rigourous development of propositional modal logic: the basic language, interpretation in relational structures, axiom systems, proofs, and validity. We prove soundness and completeness of various systems using the canonical model method, study model equivalences and expressivity results, establish the finite model property, and discuss decidability and basic complexity results. We also consider topological semantics as an alternative to relational semantics, and investigate the connection between the two. Finally, we introduce modal predicate logic, incorporating first-order quantification into the system.  In the latter part of the course we turn our attention to more specialized logical systems and their applications, as determined by the interests of the class. Topics may include: epistemic and doxastic logics, multi-agent systems and the notion of common knowledge (with applications to game theory), deontic logics, logics for reasoning about counterfactuals, temporal and dynamic logics, public announcement logic, justification logic, and others.	Adam Bjorndahl	2<>4	1330	1450	DH 4303
80-616	Formal Methods II	6.0	Philosophy	The formal methods seminar series introduces a variety of formal structures that have broad applicability to issues of philosophical interest. This mini focuses on natural language semantics, including an introduction to modal logic.	Benjamin George	2<>4	1500	1620	DH 4303
80-624	Philosophy of Economics	None	Philosophy	The science of economics has come to occupy a central position in contemporary society. Because of this central position in political decision making, economics is intertwined with a number of other philosophical issues surrounding justice, rights, and fairness. The central theme of this course will be on the arguments in favor and against markets as effective solutions to political problems. This issue will allow us to analyze a wide number of foundational issues in economics including the testability of economic claims, the use of rationality postulates, the foundation of the right to property, and measuring the success or failure of an economy.	Kevin Zollman	2<>4	0900	1020	WEH 5312
80-635	Seminar: Deliberative Democracy: Theory & Practice	None	Philosophy	Over the past 20 years, deliberative democracy has emerged as a major political theory. As a theory, it has also influenced the development of a number of grassroots organizations such as EveryDay Democracy and has led to a number of democratic innovations, such as Deliberative Polls.   This course will look at the history and concepts that form the background for the theory of deliberative democracy. We will also explore the connection between the theory and its practical applications. Finally, we will see how the theory and practice of deliberative democracy can work at the local, state and national level. Examples will be drawn from Campus and Community Conversations as well as larger initiatives designed to inform public policy in areas such as same-sex marriage, climate change and the issue of abortion in America.	Robert Cavalier	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 150
80-713	Category Theory	None	Philosophy	Category theory is a formal framework devoted to studying the structural relationships between mathematical objects. Developed in the mid-20th century to attack geometrical problems, subsequent progress has revealed deep connections to algebra and logic, as well as to mathematical physics and computer science. The course emphasizes two perspectives. On one hand, we develop the basic theory of categories, regarded as mathematical structures in their own right. At the same time, we will consider the application of these results to concrete examples from logic and algebra. Some familiarity with abstract algebra or logic required.	Jonas Frey	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 150

80-782	Phonetics and Phonology I	12.0	Philosophy	This course aims to provide students with practical tools for the study of speech sounds. The acoustic properties of sounds are examined using spectrograms and other devices, with emphasis on vowels and sonorant consonants. Following this, basic phonological notions are covered, tracing their development in the twentieth century up through optimality theory. In optimality theory, contrast and allophonic variation are explained in terms of an input-output device which selects the most harmonic candidate still faithful to phonemes in the input. The course should be relevant not only to linguistics students, but to students of language generally, with applications to sociolinguistics, child language development, speech recognition technologies, and the study of foreign languages.	Thomas Werner	2<>4	1200	0120	DH 1217
80-786	Words and Word Formation: Introduction to Morphology	12.0	Philosophy	How many words do you know?  Is gonna one word or two?  How many meanings does unlockable have?  If someone can be inept, why cant they be ept?  In this course we study the linguistics of words and word formation, known as morphology.  We begin by asking what a word is, about the internal structure of words, and how new words are formed.  Throughout, we will consider these questions from a cross-linguistic perspective, looking at morphological data from a wide range of languages.  We will also consider how morphology interacts with other subfields of linguistics, including phonology, syntax and semantics.  Finally, we will survey morphological questions from the perspectives of language acquisition, psychology, and cognitive science.	Christina Bjorndahl	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 150
80-816	Causality and Learning	None	Philosophy	Causal connections are usually more informative and helpful than associational information, especially in understanding, control, decision-making, and prediction in changing environments. In the past decades, interesting advances were made in machine learning and statistics for tackling long-standing causality problems, such as how to discover causal knowledge from purely observational data and how to infer the effect of interventions using such data. Furthermore, recently it has been shown that causal information can facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning problems.  This course explores how causality is different from and related to association, recent machine learning methods for causal discovery, and why and how the causal perspective helps in machine learning.	Kun Zhang	1<>3	1500	1620	BH 150
80-821	Seminar on Formal Epistemology	None	Philosophy	This seminar focuses on epistemic logic, with particular emphasis on topological representations. No background in topology is necessary, though some familiarity with modal logic will be very helpful. The format is presentation-style: each student will be expected to prepare (in consultation with the professor) and present approximately two papers over the course of the semester. We will tackle a series of topics, beginning with foundational and introductory works and progressing to articles of current research; topics will include general modal logic, epistemic/doxastic logic, topological semantics, subset space semantics, and public announcements. Additional topics will be chosen based on the interests and suggestions of those in the seminar.	Kevin Kelly	1<>3	1030	1150	DH 4303

In combination these sections allow us to understand how Chinas rise happened and what it means for the future of the entire globe. Issues addressed include: economic development, inequality, cyber-security and internet censorship, Intellectual Property Protection, Chinas influence in Africa, Chinas military capability, and the Beijing Consensus.  The goal of this course is to prepare students for a world where China is increasingly important, but also to ask how China got to where it is today, and where it is going as chances are highly likely that students in most any area of study will be influenced by Chinas future. This course and all source materials will be in English. No knowledge of Chinese is required.	John Givens	2<>4	0900	1020	BH A60N

82-283	Language Diversity & Cultural Identity	9.0	Modern Languages	Culture, language, and identity are intimately tied together. Individuals, families, communities, and nations identify themselves in relation to the language or languages they speak. Local, national, and international governmental organizations make choices about the language or languages they recognize and use for political and economic affairs. The United Nations even recognizes language as integral to maintaining the cultural heritage of communities and peoples around the world, and the freedom to choose ones language of expression as a universal human right.   In this course, we will explore a variety of questions, advantages, and challenges related to language diversity and cultural identity across the globe. Our main focus will be on contexts of multilingualismthat is, contexts in which two or more languages may be used. Adopting a comparative case study approach, we will explore the following themes: (i) The historical underpinnings of language diversity and its consequences for cultural identity today (e.g., migration, colonization, conquest); (ii) How language diversity and cultural identity shapes, and is shaped by, local, regional, national, and international politics; (iii) The relationship between language diversity and language use and visibility in public spaces (i.e., the linguistic landscape); (iv) Relations between linguistic communities (e.g., majority and minority language users) and the sense of belonging to a culture.   The course is taught in English. Students who wish to take the course as a Modern Languages major or minor elective will need to complete their final project on a topic relevant to the language they study.

82-294	(Un)Happiness in Russian Life and Art	9.0	Modern Languages	In one of his novels, Fyodor Dostoevsky poses an urgent question to readers: Which is better: cheap happiness, or exalted suffering? Well, which is better? Happinesswhat it means, how to measure it, and how to achieve itis something we often ponder in private, but increasingly it is something we think about publicly, too. The subject comes up as often in international policy debates as it does in dorm rooms. The United Nations now issues reports on global happiness. But what is happiness? How does it differ from place to place, from one time to another? This course will examine happiness as a concept in Russian and Soviet culture, one that was fiercely contested during key moments of radical change, such as the Bolshevik Revolution, Stalinism, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Through a wide range of works by Russian writers (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky), artists (Malevich), and filmmakers (Eisenstein, Tarkovsky), students will become familiar with how different ideas of happiness have shaped Russian life and art, and develop a critical perspective on contemporary discussions of happiness. The course will be conducted entirely in English, and no prior knowledge of Russian or familiarity with Russian culture is required. Students should expect to complete reading assignments, participate in class discussions, and write three short essays. There will also be opportunities for students to interact with members of the Russian-speaking community in Pittsburgh.	Tatyana Gershkovich	2<>4	1530	1650	BH 154A

Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently.  This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies. The course will be taught in Spanish.	Kenya Dworkin	2<>4	1330	1450	PH 125B

Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and cultures will compare and contrast the experiences of people from the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream US society. We will examine a wide variety of materials, including texts, film, art, music etc. in order to gain a better understanding of Latino populations in the United States. Ultimately, we seek to question and to understand the complexities of Latinidad in the 21st century U.S. The course will be taught in Spanish.	Therese Tardio	1<>3<>5	1130	2420	PH A19A

82-415	The French in America	9.0	Modern Languages	This repeatable course explores target cultures through a thematic or conceptual focus. Students critically analyze authentic documents through, for example, historical, biographical, filmic, artistic, literary, musical, and theoretical perspectives, while improving and expanding their language skills. FALL 2015: From the 1889 Paris Exposition to Charlie Hebdo: Cross-Cultural Encounters in French Society This course will examine several instances of cross-cultural encounters and their influence on French society. As we analyze literature, visual arts, social debates, and current events, we will investigate how contacts with various forms of alterity have informed conceptions of identity and difference in 20th century France. The construction of Frenchness will be analyzed through the ways in which the society reacts to difference. To achieve these goals, the seminar will focus on five key moments in French history: the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, the Interwar period, the Second World War and the Jewish Holocaust, the tourism boom of the 1990s, and the current debates on immigration and integration. Readings will include Pierre Lotis Aziyad, Marguerite Duras Un Barrage contre le Pacifique, Annette Mullers La Petite Fille du Vel dHiv, and Hergs Tintin en Amrique. The course will also examine the filmic representations of alterity in Abdellatif Kechiches Vnus Noire and Rose Bosches La Rafle. Social debates and current events will add another level of perspective to our study of French society.	Bonnie Youngs	2<>4	1200	0120	PH A20
82-420	The Crucible of Modernity:Vienna 1900	9.0	Modern Languages	Vienna 1900 was many things: the political center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism and of psychoanalysis;  the home of cafe culture and the waltz; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; and the showcase for historicism. And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism.   The class explores Vienna before the collapse of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas, which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. From history and politics we will move on through art, architecture, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings.  Using an enhanced historical map of the city as a digital interface and an interactive learning tool, we will add a crucial visual component to the course and research the connections between urban and architectural space and the intellectual activity that took place in it. You will work in teams with students from other disciplines. You will research networks of intellectual and artistic activities and create 3D models of the spaces, from public squares to cafe interiors, in which these intellectual activities took place. You will create and expand a growing collection of records, photos, archival materials, as well as artwork, music and other media in an effort to reconstruct the dialogue among the arts and the cultural debate of this key moment in the passage to Modernism. No previous knowledge of 3D modeling software is required, software instruction and tutoring will be provided.

82-422	German Literature of the Early Twentieth Century	9.0	Modern Languages	From its inception in 1871, The Second German Empire promised to be an industrial, cultural and military powerhouse on the continent of Europe. But when the hand of the Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, was removed from the helm by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, the New Germany charted a course that would lead to a catastrophic conflict with its neighbors to the west (England and France) and to the east (Russia). This course exams works by some of the major authors of this period (Mann, Wedekind, Hauptmann, Rilke, Kafka) as well as modern film adaptations of their works. Readings will also include seminal thinkers such as Nietzsche, Freud, Marx and Einstein. In addition, the course will employ the visual arts through a survey of the German Expressionists. The purpose of this course is to examine a wide variety of cultural artifacts against the backdrop of the political, social, and economic currents of the period.

This will involve the analysis and application of assimilation, transculturation and bilingualism theory, and rhetorical/translational problematics of the material under examination. Also of interest will be an ongoing class discussion of Latinos/Hispanics in history, the media, entertainment, politics, and education. Students will consider the question of the borders, geographical, political and societal, that may or do exist between U.S. mainstream society, Latinos and Hispanic immigrants, and strategies employed by hyphenated-Americans for overcoming, subverting or undermining this situation. Materials for the course will include literature, film, essays, and music by and about Latinos and Hispanics in the United States.  FALL 2016: Mapping Dreams and Nightmares: Transfronteriza Aesthetics on the US-Mexico Border This course will focus on the US-Mexico border, with particular emphasis on visual representations of the border from both the US and Mexico, and on the unique, vibrant fronteriza cultures that result in the space betwixt and between.  The course will emphasize key moments and events in the history of the border, including for example the Mexican Revolution, the creation of the border patrol in the 1920s, the Bracero program, Operation Wetback, the Chicano movement, Operation Gatekeeper, and will consider how visual and textual representations have responded to and been conditioned by the political and economic relationship between the US and Mexico, particularly in the wake of neoliberal policies. We will draw on a wide variety of materials, including film, video, visual arts, performance, border theory, and literary and journalistic texts.	Therese Tardio	1<>3<>5	1330	1420	PH A19D

FALL 2016: Youth Culture  Japanese society is currently confronted with a massive array of social and cultural anomalies among its youth.  In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.

84-104	Decision Processes in American Political Institutions	9.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This is an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of politics and government in the United States.  It familiarizes the student with the basic structures and processes of American government, but moves beyond the purely descriptive into the realm of the analytical.  The main theoretical tools are spatial models of political decision-making, and models of collective action problems.  The position taken in this course is that understanding American philosophical ideas about authority, power, and freedom is as central to demystifying the U.S. form of democracy as is understanding how decision-making institutions function.  Thus, on one side, this course looks at how American political thought is infused into political institutions and society.  On the other side, it investigates institutional arrangements using rationalistic theories.  In addition, scientific writings at the intersection of psychology and economics are used to probe the possibility of gaining explanatory leverage on U.S. politics from the perspective of behavioral decision-making theories.

Second, it seeks to ensure that students clearly understand how newer theoretical approaches to the study of international relations build upon or depart from classical theories. Third, it aims to make students think critically, which involves (a) distinguishing among different explanations as illustrated in the readings; (b) evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different explanations; and c) developing ones own analytical stance. Finally, theories will be tested against the historical record by examining major policy decisions and events such as World War I, the Cuban missile crisis, nuclear weapons policy, intervention in Vietnam and Central America, the origins and end of the Cold War, 9/11, the Iraq War, and the current war against global terror.

The U.S. Supreme Court has heard cases on all of these topics in recent years, and its decisions ultimately touch the lives of all Americans. In this class we will study the Supreme Courts place in the U.S. legal system. Topics we will cover include: how a case gets to the court, the justices, the role of lawyers before the court, the purpose of oral argument, the court building and its symbolism, and media coverage of the court. Readings will range from newspaper and magazine stories to law review articles. At least once during the semester students will attend an oral argument, and cases currently before the court will be used as a reference point for class discussion. This class is geared not only toward anyone who is interested in the law or government service but also toward anyone interested in working on or being informed about the biggest issues of the day.

84-331	CMU/WSP: Congress	6.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This thematic research seminar will explore the history and current practices of Congress- the first branch under the Constitution- and its role in making public policy.  The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of how the congressional system was designed and how it currently operates, combining academic and practical experience. It will be beneficial for students serving in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. This seminar will take advantage of our Washington location by featuring guest speakers and seeking connections to current policy and political debate. In addition to studying the historical development of the Congress from its design in the Constitution to its present operations, we will examine how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public. Topics to be examined include the historical origins of the congressional system, the rules and organization of Capitol Hill, the origins of partisanship, the House and Senate rules, and the history of the Speakership.  The class will also examine a number of case studies in congressional legislating.  Seminar requirements in addition to the internship include preparation and in-class participation, a substantial research brief and several applied writing assignments related to a policy that currently is or should be before Congress.

And how are those interests pursued?  This course addresses these questions in two parts.  First, we will consider the domestic American debate on foreign policy in the Middle East, exploring key Middle Eastern trends; Americas regional interests; and the political actors and factors that shape U.S. policy in the Middle East.  We will then turn to Americas actions and relationships in the region, assessing American policy dilemmas across a wide variety of countries and events.  Students should leave this class with a strong understanding of the challenges that the U.S. faces in the Middle East, as well as an informed viewpoint regarding how well America is meeting those challenges.

It will provide a basic understanding of three different but interrelated knowledge sets: the Congress, political money and lobbying by interest groups. Student should understand that while the lectures are focused on those individual subject areas and that the semester is divided into three separate sections for that purpose, the readings later in the term will often relate to earlier lectures. This is done with the intent of connecting the dots among all these somewhat diverse topical areas.

84-349	CMU/WSP: The Theater of Politics	12.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	Over the years, this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has, rather surprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical flagship and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted in the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile; that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet oftentimes, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portraits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons? In addition to introducing students of the wonders of consistent theater-going with dynamic post-performance discussions with the artists who make the art, our focus will concern politically oriented works.     There is an extra fee of 250 with this course that the student is responsible for paying.

84-350	CMU/WSP: Campaigns and Elections	12.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This class will teach you how to better understand the fundamental factors that drive elections in America and to learn some of the skills employed by political professionals.  Many of your assignments will require you to apply the lessons of this class to real time events.  Pundits and other observers have already generated a phenomenal amount of analysis and commentary about the 2012 election and occasionally they have even been right.  The goal in this class is to go beyond the spin and hyperbole of many election commentators and understand how voters decide and how strategists persuade.  And, to give you some of the technical skills to get an interesting job with a campaign. This class will combine the insights of campaign professionals with insight from the study of previous campaigns and core academic knowledge.  It will combine theory, practice, and exploration, taking the insights of political scientists and political practitioners and rolling them into one. Particular emphasis on Congress, the White House, executive bureaucracy, interest groups, and media.

84-360	CMU/WSP: Internship Seminar	12.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	The internship is the experiential core of the Washington Semester Program.  Students intern three days per week, for approximately 24-25 hours, in offices from Capitol Hill to the White House and including opportunities in cabinet agencies, nonprofit institutions, museums, advocacy groups, policy think tanks, cultural institutions, and news organizations.  Through the internship, students gain professional experience and make long-lasting professional and personal contacts. In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty for a 2-hour seminar to report and reflect on their internship experiences, and address pressing current issues from the perspective of their internship organization.   In addition, the weekly seminar typically includes 1-2 CMU alumni from the Washington, DC, area. Their personal and professional experiences become part of the seminar conversation, and they make themselves available to students as ongoing sources of information and advice.

84-362	Diplomacy and Statecraft	9.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	Statecraft (the management of state power to promote national interests) and diplomacy (the use of negotiations and non-lethal tactics to manage interstate relations and transnational threats) is central to international politics. This course introduces students to modern diplomatic history, fundamental theories of statecraft and geopolitics, principles of international negotiation, and the worlds pressing contemporary diplomatic challenges. In the first half of the semester, lectures, readings, and discussions survey the evolution of diplomacy, the construction of grand strategies, and the practice of great power diplomatic history from the Peace of Westphalia to the end of the Cold War. In the second half of the semester, students engage in debate, diplomatic simulations, and give student presentations on contemporary diplomatic challenges from a U.S. perspective. Specific units cover coercive diplomacy, peace diplomacy, human rights diplomacy, democracy promotion, economic statecraft, and diplomacy addressing transnational threats and rogue states. The course ends with a series of case studies of diplomacy concerning big issues: the Arab-Israeli peace process, global climate change negotiations, the maintenance of world order, and engagement of major powers from Iran to Russia to China. Most (but not all) course readings are written by renowned statesmen and former career diplomats rather than by academics. Students are encouraged to think, act, and write like a diplomat and to appreciate diplomacy as a vocation. Through the course, students connect diplomatic trend lines with todays international headlines.	John Chin	1<>3	1500	1620	PH 226C
84-366	Presidential Politics: So, You Want to Be President of the United States	9.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	The person elected president of the United States immediately assumes many roles. These include, but are not limited to, the following: head of government, head of state, and chief operating officer of the federal bureaucracy. The newly elected president also must find a way to work toward major policy goals with a generally contentious Congress, regardless of whether there is divided government. Legislative-executive relations have an impact on the judiciary. Senate confirmation of the presidents Supreme Court nominees is one vivid example. As the only nationally elected official in the US, the president also has a bully pulpit- the unique opportunity among all government officials to engage with the American public.  Using analytical perspectives and theories from the discipline of political science, this course takes a close look at the US presidency. It investigates what it takes to get elected and what the president does that is distinct among all government officials, domestic and international. It also examines the relationship between the president and US society. At the end of the semester, students will have a deep understanding of the US presidency and will be ready for further study of the office and US government. Those who seek to be president will have been forewarned.	Dov Levin	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 235A
84-380	Grand Strategy in the United States	9.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This course introduces students to the concept of grand strategy in the United States, broadly defined as the combination of diplomatic, economic, military, and political factors used by American presidents and their administrations to advance U.S. interests throughout the world.  In the context of highly interdependent domestic and international politics, leaders must develop strategies that address a diverse range of internal, state, and non-state challenges while also dealing with the myriad challenges resulting from globalization, or the intersection of international politics, culture, markets, and technology.  This course will review American diplomatic history over the ages, with a focus on both Cold War and post- Cold War American presidencies and their respective approaches to defending American national security whilst also playing a role as one of the worlds leading powers.

84-388	Concepts of War and Cyber War	None	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This course examines traditional theories, concepts, and practices in international relations and warfare- conventional, unconventional, and modern- and relates them to the emerging dynamics of cyber war. The principle concepts examined in this course reflect, have shaped, and continue to shape state and non-state actor behaviors and their calculations of how to prepare for and prosecute warfare. These include, among others, conventional and nuclear deterrence, offense-defense dynamics, first strike capabilities, and irregular warfare. The course will focus on theory but will leverage history, military doctrine, and cases to highlight the challenges of integrating cyber war into defense planning and practice. Students will be challenged to consider how the 2009 introduction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain- in addition to land, maritime, air, and space- affects the ways that scholars and practitioners- operating with force structures and strategic, operational, and tactical concepts that are decades, if not centuries old- conceive of and practice warfare in the 21st Century.  The principle objective of this course is to introduce students to cyber war within the context of traditional, and emerging, concepts of armed and unarmed warfare. This course will focus on two core areas: 1) a discussion of traditional concepts of warfare in the physical domains; and, 2) a discussion of cyber war and its intersection with these traditional concepts.

84-722	Comparative Political Institutions Graduate Seminar	12.0	Institute for Politics and Strategy	This course examines the foundations of the comparative analysis of political institutions, analyzes how institutions vary across countries, and explores some of the consequences of such variation. The first section introduces the analysis of institutions, discusses the predominant theories that address institutional variation and change, and presents the development of modern state institutions. The second segment discusses how relevant political institutions differ worldwide, including regime types (democracies versus non-democracies), forms of democratic regime (presidential and parliamentary systems), constitutions, electoral rules, legislatures, political parties, veto players and informal institutions. The third section centers on the consequences of political institutions, with an emphasis on the analysis of empirical evidence from developing and developed countries. A primary concern throughout the course is how the potential endogeneity among institutions affects our capacity to achieve reliable inferences. Methodologically, this course mainly builds on the rational choice school, but also integrates other perspectives.	Ignacio Arana	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 154A

A great deal of attention is given to US national security policy, but because national security policy is perforce about nation states, transnational actors, international and regional organizations, and above all about people around the globe, this course is about international security and international relations.  In particular, this course addresses the following: why wars occur and end; how domestic political arrangements affect decision making around war and peace; how global terrorism is both similar to and different from other types of threats; the role of public attitudes in various aspects of national security policy; and how decisions by leaders and their relevant constituents to acquire certain types of weapons systems influence domestic and international politics.  Understanding big theories and ideas requires novel approaches.  Thus, this course is marked by intensive discussions with the authors of the assigned books and articles as well as discussions with them about other state-of-the-art writings.

85-131	Memory and Memory Illusions	9.0	Psychology	If you think your memory works like a video recorder or tape recorder, think again. If you think intention to learn information matters for remembering, think again. We store lots of information but our memories are imperfect and vulnerable to many types of errors.  In this seminar you will learn how human memory works, including what affects what we encode, what affects how long we remember information and what affects how we remember things later.   We will read papers by leading researchers in the field of human memory as well as some chapters from textbooks.  We will watch several films concerned with how memory disorders such as anterograde amnesia affect individuals so afflicted.	Lynne Reder	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 336A

85-341	Organizational Communication	9.0	Psychology	Much of the work in groups and organizations consists of communication. You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking, and managing impressions. Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work. Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures. Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks. Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what youve learned.	Robert Kraut	2<>4	0900	1020	SH 208
85-345	Meaning of Mind and brain	9.0	Psychology	What does it mean to say that an object, word, event or sentence means something?  What is the nature of semantic representations that are activated in the brain during comprehension, and how are they related to perceptual, linguistic, mnemonic and motor representations?  How do these representations emerge over the course of development, and how can they be selectively impaired by brain damage?  This course examines these and related questions by drawing on findings from a broad range of methodologies, including developmental studies of young children, behavioral studies of adults, neuropsychological studies of brain-damaged patients, neurophysiology and functional brain imaging, and computational modeling.  The course will take a seminar format in which students read, present and discuss the current literature.	David Plaut	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 336B
85-351	Personality and health	9.0	Psychology	The general purpose of this course is to examine possible connections between personality and physical well-being.  Material will be presented at the outset of the semester that is designed to enable students to understand more fully how psychologists think about the concept of personality (what it is and what it does for us), how it is assessed, and how personality and health psychologists do research on the topic.  As the semester progresses, we will explore and discuss research that links certain aspects of personality to health, illness, and mortality.  The list of personality characteristics to be considered includes (but is not necessarily limited to) optimism/pessimism, conscientiousness, hostility, trait positive and negative affect, life purpose, and chronic goal adjustment strategies.  As time permits, select person variables will also be considered, e.g., the impact of depressive mood on health.  Class time will be largely taken by discussion of original research papers.  Different sets of students will be responsible for leading these discussions.  Grades will be based on a combination of class participation, quality of paper presentations, and performance on a final research paper.	Michael Scheier	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 336A
85-358	Pro-Social behavior	9.0	Psychology	This course is an advanced seminar that focuses on social psychological research involving the examination of pro-social behavior.  A heavy emphasis will be placed on classic research on helping (which investigates how, when, and why we help strangers), as well as the wide body of literature on social support (which investigates how we help, and seek help from, those who are closer to us).  Research on both help-seeking and help-provision will be covered, as well as the implications of this type of pro-social behavior for relationships and health.  The course also will cover research on other types of pro-social behavior such as empathy, altruism, forgiveness, and cooperation.      This is an advanced seminar in which you will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a topic of interest.	Brooke Feeney	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 340A
85-370	perception	9.0	Psychology	Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting.  Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.  The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.	Roberta Klatzky	2<>4	0900	1020	BH 336B
85-377	attitudes and persusaion	9.0	Psychology	This advanced undergraduate course will focus on the topic of attitude change and how various persuasive techniques are used to shape human response. The dynamics of propaganda and what makes the techniques effective on social and consumer decisions will be addressed.  The primary goals of the course are to 1) understand the dynamics of attitude change; 2) explore the mechanism by which attitude change techniques operate and 3) examine relevant theories and research in persuasion.  Examples of topics covered include the origins of attitudes, how attitudes influence judgments, social power and attitude change, and how individual decisions are influenced by the mass media.   Classic and contemporary research in the area of persuasion will be examined in the form of course readings and assignments.	Chante Boyd	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 336B
85-390	Human Memory	9.0	Psychology	Without memory, people would barely be able to function: we could not be able to communication because we would not be able to remember meanings or words, nor what anyone said to us; we could have no friends because everyone would be a stranger (no memory of meeting anyone); we could have no sense of self because we could not remember anything about ourselves either; we could not predict anything about the future because we would have no recollections of the past; we would not know how to get around, because we would have no knowledge of the environment. This course will discuss issues related to memory at all levels: the sensory registers, i.e., how we perceive things; working or short-term memory; long-term memory or our knowledge base. We will discuss the differences between procedural/skill knowledge, and declarative/fact knowledge. The topics of memory monitoring, feeling and knowing, spread of activation within memory (priming), implicit memory, and amnesia will also be covered.	Lynne Reder	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 340A
85-391	Psychology of Sleep	9.0	Psychology	This course is ONLY offered at Carnegie Mellon in Qatar. This course is an advanced seminar that focuses on the biology, psychology, and social factors of sleep and dreaming. The course will go over the history behind the scientific study of sleep, as well as the cultural and psychological underpinnings of dreaming. Students will also delve into the neuroscience and abnormal psychology of sleep. Emphasis will be placed on reading, presenting and analyzing empirical research articles. Students will also be required to fill out sleep logs and a dream diary, culminating in a final research paper analyzing their semester long sleep patterns and dreams based on research discussed in class.	Crista Crittenden	1<>3	1500	1620	CMB 2052
85-406	Autism: Psychological and Neuroscience Perspectives	9.0	Psychology	Autism is a disorder that affects many cognitive and social processes, sparing some facets of thought while strongly impacting others. This seminar will examine the scientific research that has illuminated the nature of autism, focusing on its cognitive and biological aspects. For example, language, perception, and theory of mind are affected in autism. The readings will include a few short books and many primary journal articles. The readings will deal primarily with autism in people whose IQs are in the normal range (high functioning autism). Seminar members will be expected to regularly enter to class discussions and make presentations based on the readings.     The seminar will examine various domains of thinking and various biological underpinnings of brain function, to converge on the most recent scientific consensus on the biological and psychological characterization of autism.  There will be a special focus on brain imaging studies of autism, including both structural (MRI) imaging of brain morphology and functional (fMRI and PET) imaging of brain activation during the performance of various tasks.	Marcel Just	3	1900	2150	BH 336B
85-414	Cognitive Neuropsychology	9.0	Psychology	This course will review what has been learned of the neural bases of cognition through studies of brain-damaged patients as well as newer techniques such as brain stimulation mapping, regional metabolic and blood flow imaging, and attempt to relate these clinical and physiological data to theories of the mind cast in information-processing terms. The course will be organized into units corresponding to the traditionally-defined subfields of cognitive psychology such as perception, memory and language. In each area, we will ask: To what extent do the neurological phenomena make contact with the available cognitive theories? When they do, what are their implications for these theories (i.e., Can we confirm or disconfirm particular cognitive theories using neurological data?)? When they do not, what does this tell us about the parses of the mind imposed by the theories and methodologies of cognitive psychology and neuropsychology?	Marlene Behrmann	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 336B
85-418	Contributions of psychological research to education	9.0	Psychology	The main goal of this course is for students to learn about what psychological research has to say regarding how to improve education. We will examine basic principles arising out of cognitive and developmental psychology that can inform educational practice; application of these principles to reading, writing, and mathematics; and policy issues, including ones involving universal preschool education, the Common Core State Standards, and whether college inculcates critical thinking skills.	Robert Siegler	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 336A
85-438	Educational Goals, Instruction, and Assessment	9.0	Psychology	The aim of this course is to teach students how to develop educational goals based on a detailed task analysis of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required for mastery of a particular aspect of a domain. Goals for early childhood, elementary, middle school, and high school will be discussed and related to the state and national standards. A comprehensive understanding of student achievement will be developed. The importance of matching the instructional program and its assessment to goals will be discussed and demonstrated. Assessment that focuses on covering the full range of specified goals will be studied along with diverse approaches for valid assessment. Other topics include making instructional material choices, funding, classroom management, ethics, and relation to system-level policies. Assignments will emphasize linking goals - instruction assessment. A term project will consist of an in-depth study of one central unit in a discipline or grade level.	Sharon Carver	2<>4	1630	1750	BH 336B
85-442	Health Psychology	9.0	Psychology	This course is concerned with how behavior and psychological states influence the development of and recovery from disease.  The class provides an overview of existing psychological and epidemiological data on the relationship between behavior and disease and addresses the issue of how behavior, emotion and cognition can influence the disease processes.  Topics include: measures and concepts, stress and disease, stress and coping, personal control, helplessness and disease, social support and health, reactivity to stress, behavior and hypertension, coronary heart disease, infectious diseases and immune function, and the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in health.  Only Juniors and Seniors will be admitted into the course and instructor permission is required.	Sheldon Cohen	1<>3	1500	1620	BH 340A
85-446	Psychology of Gender	9.0	Psychology	This course is devoted to the investigation of psychological gender rather than biological sex. That is, sex differences will be explored from a social psychological (e.g., socialization) perspective. Implications of both male gender role and female gender role in the areas of relationships and health will be the course focus.	Vicki Helgeson	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 340A
85-480	Internship in Clinical Psychology	None	Psychology	This course introduces students to Clinical Psychology and related mental health fields.

Students will be introduced to a variety of therapeutic approaches  and techniques (e.g. Solution-Focused, Cognitive, Client Centered, etc.) and will have the opportunity to learn the basic skills associated with each (e.g. Cognitive Restructuring, Mirroring, Empathic Highlighting, etc.).  Instruction will entail a mix of discussion and demonstration, and there will be a heavy emphasis on in-class practice of these skills.	Nick Williams	3	1530	1820	BH 336A
85-482	Internship in Psychology	None	Psychology	The Internship in Psychology is designed to enable students to gain experience in professional settings related to their studies in Psychology and earn credit for the intellectual work involved.  It is the students responsibility to locate an internship site and on-site supervisor, as well as to identify a CMU faculty sponsor. The student registers for the internship by submitting a completed internship form to Theresa Kurutz in Baker Hall 343.	Erik Thiessen	NA	NA	NA	NA
85-484	Practicum in Child Development	None	Psychology	This guided field experience is designed to help students deepen their understanding of developmental psychology by assisting in a preschool or kindergarten classroom and discussing the ways that their experiences relate to the theories they have learned previously and to new readings. Each student will individually schedule a consistent 6 hours per week helping in a Childrens School classroom (preferably 2 or 3 chunks of time).  Classroom duties will include working one-on-one and with small groups of students as they do puzzles, art projects, dramatic play, etc., as well as helping with snack, playground supervision, classroom cleanup, and storytime.  Each student will be expected to keep a journal 1) relating general experiences to developmental theories and 2) documenting the development of a particular child during the semester.  All students will meet for a 1 hour weekly discussion with the director. Discussion topics and related readings will be selected collaboratively, based on issues/questions raised by the groups observations and discussions.  This course is typically 9 units, but may be negotiable between 3 and 9.	Sharon Carver	3	1030	1150	MM 17D
85-505	Readings In Psychology	None	Psychology	As the name implies, the emphasis in the Reading course is on reading articles and books in some specified area. The students work in the course must lead to the production of a written paper which will be read by the instructor directing the readings. Often the reading is related to a research project which the student may wish to conduct. Readings courses have also been used to give students an opportunity to receive instruction in areas which are not included elsewhere in our course listing.  The course may be taken for any number of units up to 9, depending upon the amount of work to be done.	Erik Thiessen	NA	NA	NA	NA

85-601	Senior Thesis	9.0	Psychology	This course is intended for senior Psychology or Cognitive Science majors who wish to conduct a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor.  The project topic is to be selected jointly by the student and the advisor.   The project will culminate in a senior paper which will be presented to the Department Head at the end of Fall Semester.  Prerequisite:  Grade of B or better in a previous research course required to enter, grade of B or better in first semester of senior thesis course required to complete, and permission of instructor.  A formal proposal is required in the first semester.  This course differs from the Honors Thesis sequence (66-501,502) in that it does not require Honors standing in HSS (i.e., there are no QPA requirements).  This course differs from Research in Psychology (85-507,508) in that the students original contribution to the research is expected to be more substantial, and in that a final written report of the project is to be presented to the Department.

85-706	Graduate Core: Cognitive Psychology	9.0	Psychology	The themes of the course are:  What is the architecture of cognition, and how is it neurally instantiated?  The pedagogical goals are to impart basic knowledge of cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, while facilitating the transition from basic material in secondary texts to thoughtful analysis and integration of the primary research literature.  The course will be divided into five units and a wrap-up session.  There will be an evaluation after each unit following the first. GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY.	Brian MacWhinney	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 342F
85-714	Cognitive Neuropsychology	9.0	Psychology	This course will review what has been learned of the neural bases of cognition through studies of brain-damaged patients as well as newer techniques such as brain stimulation mapping, regional metabolic and blood flow imaging, and attempt to relate these clinical and physiological data to theories of the mind cast in information-processing terms. The course will be organized into units corresponding to the traditionally-defined subfields of cognitive psychology such as perception, memory and language. In each area, we will ask: To what extent do the neurological phenomena make contact with the available cognitive theories? When they do, what are their implications for these theories (i.e., Can we confirm or disconfirm particular cognitive theories using neurological data?)? When they do not, what does this tell us about the parses of the mind imposed by the theories and methodologies of cognitive psychology and neuropsychology?	Marlene Behrmann	1<>3	1030	1150	BH 340A
85-718	contributions of psychological research to education	None	Psychology	The main goal of this course is for students to learn about what psychological research has to say regarding how to improve education. We will examine basic principles arising out of cognitive and developmental psychology that can inform educational practice; application of these principles to reading, writing, and mathematics; and policy issues, including ones involving universal preschool education, the Common Core State Standards, and whether college inculcates critical thinking skills.	Robert Siegler	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 336A
85-732	Data Science Approaches for Psychology	9.0	Psychology	This course will cover advanced topics in statistics and experimental design necessary for applied research in modern psychology, including information design, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, nonparametric statistics, data and inference errors (multicollinearity, overfitting, Simpsons and Robinsons paradox), sanitization (data anonymization, de-identification), and linear models (including conditional process models). Students will get hands on experience with simulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in the R statistical environment.	Timothy Verstynen	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 336B
85-738	Educational Goals, Instruction, and Assessment	None	Psychology	The aim of this course is to teach students how to develop educational goals based on a detailed task analysis of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required for mastery of a particular aspect of a domain. Goals for early childhood, elementary, middle school, and high school will be discussed and related to the state and national standards. A comprehensive understanding of student achievement will be developed. The importance of matching the instructional program and its assessment to goals will be discussed and demonstrated. Assessment that focuses on covering the full range of specified goals will be studied along with diverse approaches for valid assessment. Other topics include making instructional material choices, funding, classroom management, ethics, and relation to system-level policies. Assignments will emphasize linking goals - instruction assessment. A term project will consist of an in-depth study of one central unit in a discipline or grade level.	Sharon Carver	2<>4	1630	1750	BH 340A
85-742	Health Psychology	None	Psychology	This course is concerned with how behavior and psychological states influence the development of and recovery from disease.  The class provides an overview of existing psychological and epidemiological data on the relationship between behavior and disease and addresses the issue of how behavior, emotion and cognition can influence the disease processes.  Topics include: measures and concepts, stress and disease, stress and coping, personal control, helplessness and disease, social support and health, reactivity to stress, behavior and hypertension, coronary heart disease, infectious diseases and immune function, and the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in health. Permission of Instructor.	Sheldon Cohen	1<>3	1500	1620	BH 340A
85-745	meaning in Mind & brain	None	Psychology	What does it mean to say that an object, word, event or sentence means something?  What is the nature of semantic representations that are activated in the brain during comprehension, and how are they related to perceptual, linguistic, mnemonic and motor representations?  How do these representations emerge over the course of development, and how can they be selectively impaired by brain damage?  This course examines these and related questions by drawing on findings from a broad range of methodologies, including developmental studies of young children, behavioral studies of adults, neuropsychological studies of brain-damaged patients, neurophysiology and functional brain imaging, and computational modeling.  The course will take a seminar format in which students read, present and discuss the current literature.	David Plaut	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 336B
85-746	Psychology of Gender	None	Psychology	This course is devoted to the investigation of psychological gender rather than biological sex. That is, sex differences will be explored from a social psychological (e.g., socialization) perspective. Implications of both male gender role and female gender role in the areas of relationships and health will be the course focus.	Vicki Helgeson	1<>3	1330	1450	BH 340A
85-758	Pro-Social Behavior	None	Psychology	This course is an advanced seminar that focuses on social psychological research involving the examination of pro-social behavior.  A heavy emphasis will be placed on classic research on helping (which investigates how, when, and why we help strangers), as well as the wide body of literature on social support (which investigates how we help, and seek help from, those who are closer to us).  Research on both help-seeking and help-provision will be covered, as well as the implications of this type of pro-social behavior for relationships and health.  The course also will cover research on other types of pro-social behavior such as empathy, altruism, forgiveness, and cooperation.      This is an advanced seminar in which you will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a topic of interest. Graduate Students Only.	Brooke Feeney	2<>4	1330	1450	BH 340A
85-765	Cognitive Neuroscience	None	Psychology	This course will cover fundamental findings and approaches in cognitive neuroscience, with the goal of providing an overview of the field at an advanced level.  Topics will include high-level vison, spatial cognition, working memory, long-term memory, learning, language, executive control, and emotion.  Each topic will be approached from a variety of methodological directions, for example, computational modeling, cognitive assessment in brain-damaged humans, non-invasive brain monitoring in humans, and single-neuron recording in animals.  Lectures will alternate with sessions in seminar format. Prerequisites: Graduate standing or two upper-level psychology courses from the areas of developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, computational modeling of intelligence,  neuropsychology or neuroscience.	Carl Olson	2<>4	1030	1150	MI 130
85-770	Perception	None	Psychology	Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting.  Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.  The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.	Roberta Klatzky	2<>4	0900	1020	BH 336B
85-777	Attitudes and Persuasion	None	Psychology	This advanced undergraduate course will focus on the topic of attitude change and how various persuasive techniques are used to shape human response. The dynamics of propaganda and what makes the techniques effective on social and consumer decisions will be addressed.  The primary goals of the course are to 1) understand the dynamics of attitude change; 2) explore the mechanism by which attitude change techniques operate and 3) examine relevant theories and research in persuasion.  Examples of topics covered include the origins of attitudes, how attitudes influence judgments, social power and attitude change, and how individual decisions are influenced by the mass media.   Classic and contemporary research in the area of persuasion will be examined in the form of course readings and assignments.	Chante Boyd	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 336B

85-790	Human Memory	None	Psychology	Without memory, people would barely be able to function: we could not communicate because we would not remember meanings of words, nor what anyone said to us; we could have no friends because everyone would be a stranger (no memory of meeting anyone); we could have no sense of self because we could not remember anything about ourselves either; we could not predict anything about the future because we would have no recollections of the past; we would not know how to get around, because we would have no knowledge of the environment. This course will discuss issues related to memory at all levels: the sensory registers, i.e., how we perceive things; working and short-term memory; long-term memory or our knowledge base. We will discuss recent advances in cognitive neuroscience as they inform our understanding of how human memory works. We will discuss the differences between procedural/skill knowledge, and declarative/fact knowledge and between implicit (memories that affect behavior without conscious awareness) and explicit memory (intentional or conscious recollections).   Other topics will include clinical cases of memory problems such as various forms of amnesia. GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY.	Lynne Reder	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 340A

85-806	Autism: Psychological and Neuroscience Perspectives	None	Psychology	Autism is a disorder that affects many cognitive and social processes, sparing some facets of thought while strongly impacting others. This seminar will examine the scientific research that has illuminated the nature of autism, focusing on its cognitive and biological aspects. For example, language, perception, and theory of mind are affected in autism. The readings will include a few short books and many primary journal articles. The readings will deal primarily with autism in people whose IQs are in the normal range (high functioning autism). Seminar members will be expected to regularly enter to class discussions and make presentations based on the readings.     The seminar will examine various domains of thinking and various biological underpinnings of brain function, to converge on the most recent scientific consensus on the biological and psychological characterization of autism.  There will be a special focus on brain imaging studies of autism, including both structural (MRI) imaging of brain morphology and functional (fMRI and PET) imaging of brain activation during the performance of various tasks.

85-851	personality and Health	None	Psychology	The general purpose of this course is to examine possible connections between personality and physical well-being.  Material will be presented at the outset of the semester that is designed to enable students to understand more fully how psychologists think about the concept of personality (what it is and what it does for us), how it is assessed, and how personality and health psychologists do research on the topic.  As the semester progresses, we will explore and discuss research that links certain aspects of personality to health, illness, and mortality.  The list of personality characteristics to be considered includes (but is not necessarily limited to) optimism/pessimism, conscientiousness, hostility, trait positive and negative affect, life purpose, and chronic goal adjustment strategies.  As time permits, select person variables will also be considered, e.g., the impact of depressive mood on health.  Class time will be largely taken by discussion of original research papers.  Different sets of students will be responsible for leading these discussions.  Grades will be based on a combination of class participation, quality of paper presentations, and performance on a final research paper.	Michael Scheier	2<>4	1500	1620	BH 336A

86-371	Philosophy of Perception	9.0	Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition	This will be a course that covers the philosophy of perception from an empirical perspective. The first third of the course will begin with the problem of perception: how to account for the subjective quality of perception. We will explore theoretical challenges to providing an explanation of this feature (which we can call consciousness) and canvas theories that try to provide explanations. In the last two-thirds of the course, we focus on the science as a way of understanding subjective experience. We look carefully at color perception, olfaction, integration in the senses and the role of attention. This course will be a joint seminar between CMU and Pitt and will be co-taught with students from both campuses attending. It will be an upper level course meeting once a week and a high level of discussion, writing and preparation is expected. While there are no prerequisites, students might be aided by having at least one course in philosophy (preferably philosophy of mind or philosophy and psychology) or coursework in perceptual psychology or neuroscience.	Wayne Wu	4	1330	1620	MI 115
86-375	Computational Perception	9.0	Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition	In this course, we will first cover the biological and psychological foundational knowledge of biological perceptual systems, and then apply computational thinking to investigate the principles and mechanisms underlying natural perception. The course will focus on vision this year, but will also touch upon other sensory modalities.  You will learn how to reason scientifically and computationally about problems and issues in perception, how to extract the essential computational properties of those abstract ideas, and finally how to convert these into explicit mathematical models and computational algorithms.  Topics include perceptual representation and inference, perceptual organization, perceptual constancy, object recognition, learning and scene analysis. Prerequisites: First year college calculus, some basic knowledge of linear algebra and probability and some programming experience are desirable.	Tai-Sing Lee	1<>3	1330	1450	PH 226A
86-631	Neural Data Analysis	9.0	Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition	The vast majority of behaviorally relevant information is transmitted through the brain by neurons as trains of actions potentials. How can we understand the information being transmitted? This class will cover the basic engineering and statistical tools in common use for analyzing neural spike train data, with an emphasis on hands-on application. Topics may include neural spike train statistics (Poisson processes, interspike intervals, Fano factor analysis), estimation (MLE, MAP), signal detection theory (d-prime, ROC analysis, psychometric curve fitting), information theory, discrete classification, continuous decoding (PVA, OLE), and white-noise analysis. Each topic covered will be linked back to the central ideas from undergraduate probability, and each assignment will involve actual analysis of neural data, either real or simulated, using Matlab. This class is meant for upper-level undergrads or beginning graduate students, and is geared to the engineer who wants to learn the neurophysiologists toolbox and the neurophysiologist who wants to learn new tools. Those looking for broader neuroscience application (eg, fMRI) or more focus on regression analysis are encouraged to take 36-746. Those looking for more advanced techniques are encouraged to take 18-699. Prerequisites: undergraduate probability (36-225/227, or its equivalent), some familiarity with linear algebra and Matlab programming	Steven Chase	2<>4	1330	1450	MI 130

88-120	Reason, Passion and Cognition	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	This course will introduce students to major concepts and theories in the social and decision sciences, focusing in particular on  how cognition and emotion shape judgment and choice. We will address such questions as: In what ways do emotions influence judgments and choices? What are some common mistakes in judgment and decision making? Can information shape our choices even if we do not consciously recognize the information? Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding: (1) basic theories and research findings of decision science and psychology, and (2) the relevance of research findings to everyday life.

88-125	Freshman Seminar: Forecasting Uncertainty	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Whenever you make a plan, you have to think about the future.  Sometimes you know a lot, sometimes you know very little, and sometimes you know very little but think you know a lot.  Amazingly, the same types of errors that you make every day are made by policymakers planning multi-billion dollar options.  In this course, we will explore these errors and methods for reducing them.  Examples will be drawn from many hot topics including climate change, health care, and government regulation.	Paul Fischbeck	2<>4	1330	1450	DH 1117
88-126	Freshman Seminar: Modeling Complex Systems	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Most of the major issues confronting humanity---such as climate change, financial collapse, ecosystem survival, terrorism, and disease epidemics---are the result of complex systems where the interactions of the pieces of the system create a whole that is rather different than any of its parts.  Unfortunately, traditional scientific methods that focus on reducing systems to their parts and then analyzing each part provide little insight into such systems.  This seminar explores the behavior of complex systems as well as how to model and understand them using both traditional tools and computer-based approaches.	John Miller	2<>4	1030	1150	PH A20
88-198	Research Training: Social and Decision Sciences	None	Social & Decision Sciences	This course is part of a set of 100-level courses offered by HSS departments as independent studies for second-semester freshmen, and first- or second-semester sophomores, in the College. In general, these courses are designed to give students some real research experience through work on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture subsequent interest in research participation. Faculty and students devise a personal and regular-ized meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum for students of about 9 work-hours per week. These courses are offered only as electives; i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units. Additional details (including a roster and descriptions of Research Training Courses available in any given semester) are available in the HSS Academic Advisory Center. Prerequisites/ restrictions: for HSS students only; only for second-semester freshmen, or first- or second-semester sophomores; minimum cumulative QPA of 3.0 (at the time of registration) required for approved entry; additional prerequisites (e.g., language proficiency) may arise out of the particular demands of the research project in question.

88-220	Policy Analysis I	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	This course provides an introduction to theories and methods for policy analysis. The main focus of the course is to develop an understanding of how theories from social science, such as economics, can help us understand policy issues such as allocation, regulation, and welfare. Throughout the course we analyze outcomes produced by private markets, by examining consumer choice, the supply and demand of factors and produced goods, and general and partial equilibrium. We also analyze the efficiency and welfare properties of such outcomes, paying special attention to the role of policy in influencing market outcomes. We consider how policy can address the efficiency and welfare shortcomings of markets that may result from informational asymmetries, industrial organization, moral hazard, transactions costs, and bounded rationality. Markets are compared in this light with organizational, governmental, and other modes of resource allocation. Grading will be based mainly on 3 exams. Homework assignments and/or quizzes will comprise a smaller part of the grade.	Mark Kamlet	1<>3	1030	1150	DH A302
88-251	Empirical Research Methods	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	This course teaches students how to evaluate and conduct original research regarding human behavior, whether it be in economic, social, or political settings. The course gives students practical experience in many of the most commonly used research techniques, including surveys, experiments, and quasi-experimental analysis. Although the course focuses primarily on the relationship between formulating research questions and implementing the appropriate methods to answer them, students can expect regularly to apply the statistical techniques learned in the course prerequisites, including regression.	Stephen Broomell	2<>4	1330	1450	SH 125
88-255	Behavioral and Applied Game Theory	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	When should a person cooperate and when should a person be selfish in an ongoing social interaction?  How can a business establish strategic partnerships when it comes to creating a pie and at the same time battle with competitors when it comes to dividing up the pie?  Strategic decision making requires a framework to think through the implications of cooperation and of competition.  Game theory is a systematic approach to understanding how people, firms, or countries interact with one another to achieve their own goals.  It combines mathematics and social science and is used in economics, political science, psychology, philosophy, and business.  In this course students will learn to apply game theory to analyze strategic situations arising in the business world as well as in politics, international relations, and everyday life.  Our focus will be on practical applicability rather than abstract theorizing.  Readings will focus on real-life stories accompanied by a full analysis of the principles involved.  The class will be organized as a seminar, centered around discussion, not lecture.  Students will also be placed in the role of strategist in occasional simulations in class.	Russell Golman	2<>4	1330	1450	PH A19C
88-281	Topics in Law: 1st Amendment	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	In their firm desire to perfect the new Constitution, which defined and limited the powers and roles of their new government, the founding fathers insisted on explicit statements that would protect the rights of the new nations citizens.   Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain.  This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the free speech amendment to the Constitution.  This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.  This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.	Mary Jo Miller	2	1830	2120	BH 136A
88-302	Behavioral Decision Making	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Behavioral decision making is the study of how people make decisions, in terms that can eventually help them to make better decisions.  It draws together research from psychology, economics, political science, and management, among other fields.  It has applications that range from managing potentially hazardous technologies, to involving patients more fully in the choice of medical procedures, to the design of computer-interactive systems.  The course covers behavioral theories of probabilistic inference, intuitive prediction, preference, and decision making.  Topics include heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, strategies for combining information from different sources and dealing with conflicting objectives, and the roles of group and emotional processes in decision making.  The course emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship between theory and application.	Baruch Fischhoff	2<>4	1030	1150	BH 235B
88-341	Organizational Communication	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Much of the work in groups and organizations consists of communication.  You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to coordinate activity, and to sell yourself and your work.  The goal of this course is to identify sources of communication problems within an organization and ways to overcome them.  To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong.  The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations.  This course is not a practicum in public speaking or writing, although you will get some experience writing, speaking and managing impressions.  Rather the intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly do when you return to work.  Readings come from both the research and the managerial literatures.  Among the topics considered are managerial communication, persuasion and conformity, self presentation and person perception, social networks.  Cases and group projects give you an opportunity to apply what youve learned.	Robert Kraut	2<>4	0900	1020	SH 208
88-345	Perspectives on Industrial Research and Development	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Incandescent and fluorescent electric lights; nylon and Kevlar61650;, the atomic bomb; the transistor and integrated circuits; Post-it61650; notes; Teflon61650;; Silly Putty61650;; GameBoys61650;; and biopharmaceuticals (from Viagra61650; and Levitra61650; to Paxil61650; and Enbrel61650;), among a panoply of other consumer and industrial goods, are all products that emerged from organized industrial research and development (RD) programs. The beginnings of this new institution in the late 19th century, its rapid rise in the first third of the 20th century, its flourishing in the middle third of the 20th century, and its decline and reorganization in the last decades of the 20th century and first decade of the 21st century are the principal focus of this advanced reading seminar.  What factors led to the establishment of modern RD? Why did industrial RD laboratories appear in the US and other industrialized nations?  How did their creation change the character of science, technology, and business?  How did the institutionalization of RD affect the work of individual inventors, engineers, and scientists?  Does big business now dominate RD in the United States, or does the little guy (including university-based start ups) still play an important role in technological innovation?  What about the interaction of universities and industrial RD programs?  How has industrial RD been managed?  How has federal science and technology policy affected industrial RD? With the globalization of business, is industrial RD also becoming global, and if so, how does industrial RD work on a global scale?  Why did the last decade of the 20th century see the decline or disappearance of numerous prestigious industrial research organizations?  What is the future of industrial RD in the 21st century?  These are some of the questions explored in this course, which is open to serious students from all colleges.	David Hounshell	1<>3	1500	1620	PH A20
88-360	Behavioral Economics	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	This course introduces students to behavioral economics, an emerging  subfield of economics that incorporates insights from psychology and other  social sciences into economics.  We will examine evidence on how human  behavior systematically departs from the standard assumptions of economics,  and then investigate attempts by behavioral economists to improve economic  analyses.

88-365	Behavioral Economics and Public Policy	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Economics has up to now been the social science that has been most broadly and deeply involved in public policy.  With its rational choice perspective, the economic perspective has tended to favor certain types of policies   namely those   that enhance the efficiency of market mechanisms and lower the cost of information.  In this course we will spend the first several classes reviewing the assumptions, implications for public policy and limitations of the rational   choice perspective.  The remainder of the course will then be devoted to examining different public policy issues, including saving, health care, crime and drug abuse, through the competing lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.

88-418	Negotiation - Domestic Focus	9.0	Social & Decision Sciences	Negotiation is the art and science of securing an agreement between two or more interdependent parties. Decision-makers use negotiation to reach agreements with co-workers, bosses, clients, subordinates, firms, family and friends. Hence, the ability to negotiate effectively is a critical skill. In this course, students will develop a systematic and insightful approach to negotiation. Students will learn to analyze the features of the negotiation environment, develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies and tactics, and identify the barriers and the psychological factors that may prevent decision-makers from reaching wise agreements. Considerable emphasis will be placed on negotiation exercises and role-playing. In-class discussions and lectures will supplement the exercises. This course will focus on negotiations in a wide variety of context: public policy negotiations, business negotiations, salary negotiations, and inter-personal negotiations.

The beginnings of this new institution in the late 19th century, its rapid rise in the first third of the 20th century, its flourishing in the middle third of the 20th century, and its decline and reorganization in the last decades of the 20th century and first decade of the 21st century are the principal focus of this advanced reading seminar.  What factors led to the establishment of modern RD? Why did industrial RD laboratories appear in the US and other industrialized nations?  How did their creation change the character of science, technology, and business?  How did the institutionalization of RD affect the work of individual inventors, engineers, and scientists?  Does big business now dominate RD in the United States, or does the little guy (including university-based start ups) still play an important role in technological innovation?

This new course will provide an overview of approaches to this difficult process of social policy making with a focus on the role that social forces and the state play in the generation of policy responses to poverty and inequality.  The course will discuss the role that new approaches to social policy play in the alleviation of poverty and inequality, including the impact of Conditional Cash Transfers such as Bolsa de Familia. Ongoing debates on the advantages and disadvantages of public versus private programs in the areas of social security and health will also be analyzed. The first section of the course will focus on approaches to poverty and inequality in the US and Western Europe and the second one on Africa and Latin America.	Silvia Borzutzky	3	1800	2050	HBH 1007

90-823	Program Evaluation	12.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.

90-836	Health Systems	6.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	Health Systems is a foundation course intended to introduce students to many of the broad subjects that will be detailed in more advanced course work. This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery.  Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals and outcomes.  Utilizing the two textbook books, students will gain an understanding of the topics of health policy, public health, population health and healthcare delivery.	James Jordan	2	1800	2050	HBH A301
90-847	The Panama Papers, Grand Corruption and Law Enforcement	12.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course will address the implementation challenges facing international anti-corruption agreements, notably the UN Convention against Corruption and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  Getting signatory countries laws and regulations to be consonant with the provisions of these conventions is only the first stage of what is, in fact, a two-stage implementation process. The second stage is the enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations. This stage, which fosters deterrence and strengthens the rule of law vital to economic development, will be the focus of the course.  The course will examine cases of grand corruption across the world, including in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Among the countries to be covered will be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and others. The course will discuss different strategies and solutions that leaders in governments, non-government organisations and private sector can consider to improve, at a global level, the implementation of UNCAC and OECD anti-bribery convention. At the national level, the course will discuss and develop recommendations to enhance the enforcement of anti-corruption laws in terms of effective detection, investigation, prosecution and sanctions against corruption, with due consideration to different country contexts.

90-851	Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy	6.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	Science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nations economy in areas such as energy, transportation, communication, agriculture, education, environment, health, defense, and jobs. As a result, government policymakers are interested in almost every aspect of science and technology innovations and innovation policy.  This course will provide students with a better understanding of the relationship between science, technology, innovation and economic growth; the policy and process mechanisms used to encourage innovation; and, how scientific and technical organizations influence the shaping of innovation policy. Upon completion of this course, students should have a deeper and more strategic understanding of how innovation policies are developed and who influences them, how to analyze and present a policy analysis for an innovation or innovation policy, and emerging issues in innovation policy.   Although the focus will be on U.S. innovation policy, the discussion will incorporate international policies and perspectives. Open to graduate students and seniors. Open to juniors with permission only.	Deborah Stine	2<>4	1500	1620	PH 226A

The course addresses both the what and how of leading policy change, combining content presentation and discussion with a workshop structure and iterative approach to each assignment. This format is informed by my experience opening a successful urban high school, serving on the leadership teams of two superintendents, and leading an educator effectiveness initiative across more than 50 schools.  Content of the course - We begin with the basics, looking at different perspectives about the purpose of schooling and the history, structure, funding and current state of public education in the United States. - From there we dig into contemporary issues, exploring relevant topics in education policy today. This semester well focus on school design and choice, educator effectiveness, and curriculum. - The third section focuses on leading change. Here we look at what it takes to be a successful leader in the field, how to manage change, and the many career pathways available in public education. - Finally, we close by contemplating the future of education, exploring possibilities for transforming how we learn and changing how we think about school.

These topics are treated assuming the perspective of the decision maker. It addresses typical problems of large, medium and small firms having a structured RD and operating businesses where RD is the source of competitive advantages. Although we will heavily focus on RD, emphasis is placed on viewing RD as a part (although, a key part) of the process of technological innovation; therefore, as an activity to be strongly and appropriately integrated with other functions to make innovation successful.

With its rational choice perspective, the economic perspective has tended to favor certain types of policies, namely those that enhance the efficiency of market mechanisms and lower the cost of information. In this course we will spend the first several classes reviewing the assumptions, implications for public policy, and limitations of the rational choice perspective. The remainder of the course will then be devoted to examining different public policy issues, including saving, health care, crime and drug abuse, through the competing lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.

90-894	Policy Topics I: Federal Budget Policy	6.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	Why do we have such large budget deficits? Why does Congress have such a hard time getting to agree on budget policy? Why is there such pork barrel spending and government waste in Washington? The answers to these questions, and others like them, require a detailed knowledge of the law and politics that lie behind the budget process, and the difficult policy choices that make up that process each year.  This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isnt For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent.  Track II will introduce you in some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors.  When we are working on Track II, you will develop two-pagers, the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers.

90-896	Policy Topics: International Development Policy	6.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course is taught from the point of view of the policy entrepreneur faced with developing policy on international development in an environment of competing priorities and paradigms, complex problems, diverse constituents, and multiple international stakeholders. The perspective of four different actors will be highlighted throughout the course: US Government; non?governmental organization; developing country; and multilateral institution. Students will learn analytic frameworks to hone their skill in two distinct components of policymaking: crafting sound policies and mastering the policy process. The course readings and guest lectures will provide insight and a realistic grounding in how to operate most effectively in the fluid and fastpaced global policy environment, and provide lessons on how to navigate and prevail in the highly contentious and charged policy debates surrounding international development. This course will not delve deeply into the equally challenging area of policy implementation, though suggested readings are provided. The course presumes no previous knowledge or experience in international development and does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the theoretical literature in the international development field.

We achieve this initially by immersion in diverse faculty members research, and then move the students into thinking about their own research very possibly initially as an extension of some faculty members research  by preparing and presenting a brief research proposal to be critiqued by your colleagues and then revised as you see fit to take account of those critiques.

90-908	Ph.D. Microeconomics	12.0	Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course provides a semester-long introduction to microeconomic analysis and its application. The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations.    This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper.	Brian Kovak	2<>4<>5	0900	1020	HBH 1004

91-820	Strategic Planning	12.0	Public Management:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course emphasizes strategic planning processes and focusses on setting strategic objectives and developing strategies for implementing those objectives. The course teaches students the building blocks of strategic planning and introduces students to the contested theories of how to develop and implement plans.  The content of the course includes exploring the basic concepts used in strategic planning; distinguishing between operational matters (organisational effectiveness) and strategic matters (leadership); analysing the organisations internal and external environments; and achieving alignment between them. A considerable amount of time is spent on developing skills to frame issues correctly so that strategic plans address the organisations true needs. Finally, the course addresses implementation issues, particularly those requiring change management. Students are encouraged to draw upon skills acquired in other areas, such as finance, marketing, organization management etc. in formulating the strategic plan. The assignments includes students forming teams of 4-6, with each team working on a strategic planning project with a Government agency or not-for-profit organization based in South Australia. The actual projects are sourced by the course instructor with students being able to lodge expressions of interest for their preferred project. At the end of the course, students should be able to:              Analyse the mandates, missions and values of any organisation, with particular focus on public organisations              Frame issues in a manner that allows them to be assessed as strategic              Develop strategies              Prepare implementation and change management plans.

93-703	Arts Enterprises:  Management & Structures	12.0	Creative Enterprise:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	Arts Enterprises: Structures and Management examines the fundamental structures, governance, and management systems involved in running a successful, 21st century arts enterprise.  The course goes beyond a ?principles of arts management? position to introduce students to the local, national, and international forces that make running an arts-based business unique.  Students discover how arts enterprises are governed internally (formal leadership) and externally (public policy, market forces, and financial realities). Furthermore, students learn how enterprises engage multiple stakeholders, from artists or politicians to staff or audiences. Every day arts managers are faced with choices that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder relations.  During the course, students will discern the day-to-day systems and operations of well-run arts organizations and investigate moments of failure in order to find the lessons learned. The course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of mission-impact and ROI.   This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within arts enterprises creating a foundation for subsequent, advanced coursework. Students will encounter the theoretical frameworks necessary to understand the enterprise, and then ground the theory in real-life experience, case studies, and course-exercises.  For the purpose of this course, arts enterprises will be defined as those that create relationships between artists and audiences. Arts enterprises include, but are not limited to: orchestras, opera companies, music ensembles, museums, arts centers, theatre companies, presenting organizations, multi-media centers, artist agencies, galleries, media and dance companies.

93-811	Producing a Performing Arts Season	6.0	Creative Enterprise:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure.  Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How can you take a mission into an artistic vision then enact it through a set or programs and create a system to manage the process and evaluate both artistic success but community impact and mission-centric strategic goals? How can you commission new works in an environment that provides earned income rewards for doing things people already know? Readings will include books, case studies, interviews, and articles in planning, management models and styles, and the frameworks for the unique qualities of performing arts programs (season planning, education programs, etc). The course will include participation in Pittsburgh ? based arts programming.  Guest speakers from several organizations will present their approaches to season and related programmatic planning, management and lessons learned. It is worthwhile noting that a life of reading and experiencing the performing arts is critical to successfully planning and managing performing arts programs.	Brett Crawford	2<>4	1030	1150	HBH 1007

93-828	Advanced Topics in Fundraising	6.0	Creative Enterprise:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	This course will go beyond the basics introduced in Fundraising Fundamentals and cover a number of special topics including fundraising campaigns, planned giving, special events, individual major gifts, the use of fundraising consultants, and the creation of a development plan. In smaller organizations, every member of the development office likely needs to have at least a passing familiarity with these topics. In a larger organization, you might be in a position focused on only one area. In either case, having an understanding of these topics and the strategies that inform their use will be a valuable tool. In each section, we may hear from experts in that particular discipline to provide context based on their own experiences.	James McMahon	3	1800	2050	HBH 1004
93-831	Law and the Arts	12.0	Creative Enterprise:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	LAW AND THE ARTS is an investigation of specific legal rights and responsibilities (contractual and otherwise) in the arts and entertainment industries, including visual and performing arts and emerging areas such as multimedia art. The foundation for all activities in the arts is the contract. Accordingly, you will study contract law that will provide a clearer understanding of the requirements that must be met before a valid contract comes into existence. Contract interpretation and enforcement will also be addressed. In addition to contract law, we will also discuss tort law, agency law, corporate, partnership and limited liability company law, personal and real property law, intellectual property law (copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of publicity, moral rights) and other laws specifically affecting the entertainment industries. Finally, typical performing arts contracts and contractual provisions will be reviewed and the concepts discussed in other parts of the class, as applied to those contracts, will be analyzed.

93-836	International Perspectives on Managing Arts and Heritage	6.0	Creative Enterprise:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt	Arts management faces enormous differences in contexts across the world. While systematically detailing these differences would require a whole program on its own, this course will provide a basic understanding of the variety of contexts within an international comparative view, providing some basic analytical tools and developing skills to deal with these aspects. The focus will be on countries other than the US (assuming that CMU students already get a deep knowledge of the domestic reality): based on extensive field research in the last two decades, case studies provided are outside the realm of influence of the common law and commonwealth tradition.  A first set of differences refers to ways in which management itself is conceptualized and taught, with a different emphasis given to some basic notions (e.g. the notion of leadership as opposed to a view of management as social practices; the role of goals versus processes). Moreover, serious variations in managing are related to the different role played by philanthropy, the market or the state: elements of public administration are needed to interact with these different contexts; different meanings assumed by cultural polices also need to be understood.  Finally, cultural heritage in particular represents an important chapter in arts management in countries that place a greater emphasis on history and cultural traditions. Dealing with heritage requires additional knowledge and skills (e.g. interacting with archaeologists, historians, museologists) and attention to delicate issues of balance between preservation and uses, fragile issues of long term sustainability, and soft implications in terms of identity building.

Arguably, the better a consultant you are, the better a communicator you are, and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other soft skills can derail a consulting engagement and with it, a promising consulting career. As an example, a Gartner Group study found that 80 of all IT projects were late, over budget, or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset.  This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value, incisive questions to building strong, long-term client relationships	Stefan Labash	2<>4	1330	1450	HBH 1005

94-804	Transformational Leadership	6.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	The game is changing on the world stage. This requires a new type of leadership and new types of strategies. We will look at the role of the leader in the emerging global and digital world. The context of global leadership has significantly changed in the past 5 years. Technology and social media have been game changers and a number of leaders still do not use them effectively.   Regardless of your title, or the job you have you will have to display leadership qualities if you want to get ahead, get noticed and close the gap between your aspirations and your reality.   Evidence based transformational leadership is driven from inner values and convictions. It is important to understand what research has shown us that constitutes effective leadership and the difference between transactional and transformational leadership. It is also important to identify how to adapt your leadership style to a situation, person or organisations culture. A number of people espouse principles of good leadership but are very poor at practicing them.  Whether you are leading in a global enterprise or a local organization, good leadership principles are the same. Regardless of your context, you will have to learn how to lead and communicate across social media platforms, respectfully and effectively lead in a culturally diverse environment and be rapidly adaptable to change.  This course will discuss the evidence base for transformational leadership, a variety of models of transformational leadership, what that means for you and how to match the right leadership model to your personality, style and work context.

94-806	Privacy in the Digital Age	6.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?  This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on:  - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols,), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards,)   - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs,)	Veronica Marotta	1<>3	1500	1620	HBH 2008

94-823	Measuring Social	12.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	Online social activity provide new and meaningful ways for individuals to engage, communicate, and organize as well as create, distribute and share information. As corporations explore and invest in this area, many are finding that there is a plethora of unstructured data that can be valuable in many different corporate functions including marketing, customer service, internal collaboration and innovation. We often refer to this data store as having 3 Vs  Velocity, Volume and Variety. You could also throw in Veracity. The difficulty lies in how to measure, report and justify expenditure and activity for initiatives in this area. Are traditional measures, like ROI, applicable or does social require new metrics that need to be understood and implemented. Unique social patterns, rapid evolution and adoption of social technologies, as well as the inherent viral nature of information on the web continues to exacerbate these issues.

94-828	Survey Design	6.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	This course is designed to provide students with a solid practical foundation in survey research methodology. We will begin by discussing how to formulate good research questions and the types of research questions that can be investigated through survey research. (Although we will briefly discuss the various survey formats, this course will focus on designing self-administered questionnaires.) Because the success or failure of a survey project rests on the individual survey items, we will spend the majority of our time learning how to develop, test, and revise survey items. In doing so, we will also consider the cognitive processes that affect how people respond to survey items, in order to ensure we are creating items that are both understandable and answerable. We will also briefly discuss survey instrument organization and design, survey administration techniques, and ethical issues in survey methodology.	Michael Bridges	2<>4	1630	1750	HBH 2008

94-833	Decision Analysis and Multicriteria Decision Making	6.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	This course complements and extends both 95-760 Decision Making under Uncertainty and the two mini sequence in Management Science (90-722  90-760). Management Science I: Optimization) by addressing three additional topics in managerial decision making: - MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) - Decision Analysis - Decision processes MCDM is a collection of methods for trading-off different alternatives performance on multiple conflicting objectives; methods discussed include weighted sum scoring models, swing weights, TOPSIS, DEA, AHP, and rank-based methods.  Decision Analysis is the prescriptive model for rationally maximizing subjective expected utility in the face of uncertainty; it is particularly powerful for dealing with sequential decisions, quantifying the value of information, assessing and incorporating subjective probabilities, and doing Bayesian updates of probabilities as new information becomes available.  Decision process considerations go beyond the paradigm of a single well-defined decision maker and mathematical method. Potential topics we could cover include industrial analytics, auctions, composite indicators (US News  World Report style ratings), balanced scorecards, dashboards of key performance indicators, group processes, and matching a decision method to the circumstances at hand.

94-840	Lean Entrepreneurship	6.0	Heinz College Wide Courses	Technology startups are not just smaller versions of large corporations. Instead they are unique adventures requiring their own agile approach to grow. This class will cover best practices for developing a startup with a primary focus on high growth technology startups. These are a particularly interesting segment because of the rapid development of social  cloud platforms often allow scalable traction from a small seed round or even bootstrapping.  While that is the focus, many principals are also applicable for large companies looking to grow by entering new markets. Also because most technology startups dont fail because of technology limitations but from lack of market demand many of the principals are universally applicable to iterative customer focused development.

95-710	Economic Analysis	6.0	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	This is a course in microeconomics and its implications for management and strategy - particularly (but not exclusively) in the context of information technology firms. Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions. The key to such optimal decision- making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance. The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models. We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions. These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition. As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms. We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents and economic outcomes in the context of game theory.	Alessandro Acquisti	1<>3	0900	1020	HBH 2008

95-744	Information Security Policy and Governance	6.0	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skillattributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy  this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies.

95-866	Advanced Business Analytics	6.0	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	Growth in Web 2.0 coincides with the growth in firms ability to collect large customer data. Firms know micro level data about customer transactions and have an ability to correlate such data with other datasets. In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a model of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy. Thus a key goal of the course is to teach students a model based approach to prediction.	Rahul Telang	2<>4	1030	1150	HBH 1005

95-874	Agile Methods	6.0	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	By far, I believe Agile Methods are the most efficient, effective and intuitive means for teams to produce valuable, complex software that businesses depend on. Industry is seeing increased hiring demand for strong, agile leadership and experienced agile practitioners, as companies of all sizes look to remain competitive in delivering quality software to their customers - and agile methods create the competitive edge. Economic drivers have forced a need for greater efficiency and significant IT cost reduction. And for the past decade, significant investment made toward maturing traditional project management, SDLC processes, organizational alignment and capability all have had limited results in (and a limited focus on) effectively delivering value. Industry has passed its tipping point in adopting agile methods, and so companies are investing in talent to help make the pivot from traditional plan-driven approaches to that of value-driven results.  Learning Objectives: 1. Students will gain hands-on skills and experience applying Agile Principles, and engage in Scrum and Kanban practices - both are popular agile methodologies in high demand with todays employers  2. Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking and applied problem solving against a complex holistic system of agile values, principles and practices, and challenges of scaling to the enterprise.  3. Students will learn the strategic business drivers and benefits of agile methods, and the inherent complexities companies experience while adopting and scaling agile to the enterprise.

95-887	Cloud Computing for Business	6.0	Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt	Cloud computing is the latest major evolution in computing. It is a paradigm where computing resources are available when needed, and you pay for their use as and when you use them. With its promise of improved efficiency and agility, cloud computing commands increasing attention from todays business executives and IT professionals.  In an enterprise that has complex and expensive IT systems to support its business processes, who would not be attracted by the idea of just being able to pay on-demand for someone else to provide IT services without being concerned with the details of how it is done? And you can escape from the confines of application upgrades and hardware obsolescence. However, jumping into the cloud without a clear strategy that is aligned with business goals may produce some short term wins, but will almost always result in unexpected costs and poorly governed data and applications.  Companies are routinely making the strategic choice of migrating their software (selling) business model from a traditional perpetual license to a subscription license-based software-as- a-service (SaaS) product are doing so to drive stronger long-term relationships and business growth. In the short term, this shift can be challenging, for some time. Generally, it takes most SaaS providers at least two years to reach break-even, even though the typical provider spends more than half its revenue to fuel new business development.  This course introduces both impacts to business and technology.   The business side lectures and discussions will help you understand business drivers, the changing business models and SaaS pricing etc. augmented by case studies.   At the same time the other half of the course will be hand-on cloud technology and programming so that you all get a fair idea of what is Cloud computing and how technology is used.

98-219	Student Taught Courses (StuCo): Engineering: My Heart is in the Work	3.0	StuCo (Student Led Courses)	The main goal of this course is to expose students to the fields of engineering studied at Carnegie Mellon. The class will emphasize different aspects of engineering such as working in groups, getting hands-on with projects and technical knowledge. We hope to get the students invested in the ideas and methods of engineering and feel a nerdy excitement for the concepts involved. We plan to focus on the sweet spots of the different fields in engineering, exposing students to the material that motivates the current upperclassmen to pursue the field while accurately representing what one might do in a typical day of majoring in that field. Each lecture will be taught by students for students. Upperclassmen from across the engineering disciplines will share their enthusiasm for their major by teaching four lectures in their area of study. This class will help incoming freshmen understand what the different engineering majors are about and will help them decide what they want to study for their four years at CMU. Additionally, it will allow students outside of engineering to be exposed to what engineering is about in general, instead of focusing on just one field of engineering.

99-406	Directed Study in Education	None	Carnegie Mellon University-Wide Studies	This course supports the development and improvement of the dozens of educational outreach endeavors implemented by university academic departments, student organizations and others.  It is noted that the Regional Impact Pillar of Carnegie Mellons strategic plan, which specifically states, We will continue to support improvements in K-12 education in the region, through both research and community service.   It is important that we continually review, evaluate and improve the educational outreach offerings of the university to ensure that accurate information is being disseminated to the appropriate audience in a way that does improve some aspect of life in the community.    Students must prepare a final work product such as a report that demonstrates independent learning was achieved.  For example, if the work is to determine the effectiveness of a university educational outreach program on the targeted population, the report should include information about the program, a review of literature related to the program goals, methods used to determine effectiveness (including any IRB approvals that are necessary), a summary of results, and recommendation of program improvement. Other projects may be designing and implementing a new outreach offering, creating a more effective method for university students to learn about and participate in educational outreach programs, or in-depth research about a topic related to education of children, such as the funding system for public schools or a review of the preparation of teachers for classroom experiences across several countries.  Note that these are not the only type of projects that are acceptable, and when registering for the independent study, students must submit a proposal for the work to the instructor.

99-452	Language and Culture for Teaching	3.0	Carnegie Mellon University-Wide Studies	Language and Culture for Teaching, is a 3 unit pass/fail class to help  graduate students who are nonnative English speakers begin to develop the  skills needed to be successful as teaching assistants (TAs). Students will  gain a better understanding of the US/ Carnegie Mellon classroom and  culturally appropriate teaching techniques, and be better prepared to take  on the role of instructor. Students will also learn how to better  communicate their knowledge and expertise to learners by: 1) working on  aspects of pronunciation crucial for the classroom, 2) developing an  awareness of key aspects of teaching fluency, 3) having frequent  opportunities to practice building aspects of teaching fluency, and 4)  learning to compensate effectively for their individual language problems.  Each student will have the opportunity to give two videotaped presentations  on topics from their fields and then to meet with the instructor for  extensive feedback and coaching. Prerequisite: Permission from the Intercultural Communication Center (ICC). Please call the ICC at 412-268-4979.	Peggy Heidish	2<>4	1030	1150	CYH A55
